## Meeting Purpose

Initial meeting of the BOOST Working Group to introduce the Biomass Open Origin Standard for Tracking (BOOST) data standard initiative.

## Key Takeaways

  - BOOST aims to develop an open, interoperable data standard for biomass chain of custody tracking, with version 0.1 funded by California Dept. of Conservation
  - Focus is on creating a flexible data architecture to enable reporting across various regulatory/certification frameworks, not aligning standards themselves
  - Key challenges include balancing detail/specificity with operational realities and addressing data privacy/sovereignty concerns
  - Next steps involve biweekly meetings through July, soliciting example datasets, and asynchronous development work

## Topics

### Introduction to BOOST Initiative

  - W3C Community Group developing data standard for biomass chain of custody
  - Goals: Improve transparency, reduce costs, increase market access
  - Open participation, but reaching out to key stakeholders
  - Using GitHub for transparent development process
  - Aiming for version 0.1 by late July 2025

### Data Standard Components

  - Modules include: Material Identity, Chain of Custody Events, Organizations, Verification/Certification, Transport/Logistics
  - Example schemas shown for each module
  - Aiming to support various chain of custody methodologies (mass balance, physical separation, etc.)
  - Documentation and use cases focused on California bioenergy regulations/certifications

### Scope and Approach

  - Geographically agnostic but initial focus on California context
  - Not trying to align regulatory standards, but enable flexible reporting
  - Balancing granular data collection (e.g. species, moisture) with operational realities
  - Addressing data privacy/sovereignty concerns, especially for sensitive information

### Stakeholder Input

  - Need for alignment with federal (RFS) and international standards highlighted
  - Importance of supporting various data types/formats (not just spreadsheets)
  - Questions raised about level of biomass classification detail (species, conditions)
  - Suggestions to consider separate data requirements for reporting vs. audits vs. business needs

### Next Steps

  - Biweekly 1-hour meetings through end of June, then weekly through July
  - Soliciting anonymized example datasets from stakeholders
  - Asynchronous development work via GitHub
  - Follow up with stakeholders for specific input/expertise
  - Circulate meeting recording and follow-up items
Action Items
  - Email Boost Working Group link to EPA webpage w/ USDA Forest Service funded report on forest residuals policy implications.  - WATCH (5 secs): https://fathom.video/share/Vx-RgRfTnfizF5Y_1ayF8BUhT41Vx1js?timestamp=2712.9999
  - Follow up w/ stakeholders for anonymized transaction/reporting data (PUC, utilities, biomass facilities). Ensure privacy (locations fuzzed, no volumes/costs).  - WATCH (5 secs): https://fathom.video/share/Vx-RgRfTnfizF5Y_1ayF8BUhT41Vx1js?timestamp=3750.9999
  - Send poll to group re: meeting schedule (2wk intervals thru June, weekly Jul). Finalize v0.1 timeline.  - WATCH (5 secs): https://fathom.video/share/Vx-RgRfTnfizF5Y_1ayF8BUhT41Vx1js?timestamp=3939.9999
