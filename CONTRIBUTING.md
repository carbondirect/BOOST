# Biomass Open Origin Standard for Tracking (BOOST) Community Group

This repository is being used for work in the W3C Biomass Open Origin Standard for Tracking (BOOST) Community Group, governed by the [W3C Community License
Agreement (CLA)](http://www.w3.org/community/about/process/cla/). To make substantive contributions,
you must join the CG.

If you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all
contributors in the pull request comment.

To add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per line as follows:

```
+@github_username
```

If you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:

```
-@github_username
```

If you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part in designing the
feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.
## 🧾 How to Sign Up for a Task

We use a structured sign-up process to ensure tasks are clearly assigned and contributors have GitHub access.

### ✅ Step 1: Register Your GitHub Username

To sign up for a task, you must first register using this form:

👉 [Register as a BOOST Contributor](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdoQOUNseqJ1DHvjvh5Q9B5h-JSo-4Tt8ViZhj-sGWDqVq4hQ/viewform?usp=header)

This helps us validate your GitHub username and avoid assignment issues. You’ll only need to do this once.

### 📋 Step 2: Choose a Task in the Sign-up Sheet

Once registered, visit the contributor task board:

👉 [BOOST Contributor Sign-up Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ds5UTHqS9Wi5RusYDKBUCmmsUk0y5Cnmb6WpUknrnow/edit?usp=sharing)

In the **“Assignee” column**, select your GitHub username from the dropdown next to the issue you'd like to take on.

> You can only assign tasks to yourself once your username is validated through the form above.

### 🔁 Step 3: Your Assignment Will Sync to GitHub

We run periodic syncs to assign users in the GitHub issue tracker. If your signup is successful, you’ll see yourself listed as the assignee within a few minutes.

If you encounter issues or want to change your signup, feel free to:
- Leave a comment on the GitHub issue
- Contact a maintainer
