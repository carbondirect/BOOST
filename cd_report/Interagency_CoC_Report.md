## Background {#background}

This research supports the need to develop a chain of custody system for tracking forest biomass from source to product for the State of California. Existing approaches are cumbersome and resource-intensive, with significant limitations in both data collection and public access to information. Carbon Direct was engaged to provide the department with recommendations for a biomass tracking system that would enhance data visibility, transparency, and stakeholder trust while reducing regulatory compliance costs relative to current practices.

### Methods

Carbon Direct conducted a comprehensive review of existing biomass tracking systems and regulatory frameworks, supplemented by stakeholder interviews with industry participants, regulatory officials, and non-governmental organizations to gather perspectives on current challenges and opportunities relative to biomass tracking. The methodology also involved close collaboration with an interagency working group to ensure recommendations aligned with regulatory requirements and could be effectively implemented across state agencies, as well as the establishment of an industry working group to facilitate adoption of the recommendations.

### Results

The results indicate that a standards-based, digital CoC system would improve biomass traceability in California while potentially also reducing compliance burdens and transaction costs. Stakeholder feedback emphasized the importance of a unified data standard and streamlined reporting to replace fragmented tracking processes. The proposed system recommendations highlight the need for flexibility to accommodate California’s diverse feedstocks and ensure stronger alignment with state programs than existing international frameworks. If implemented, a biomass tracking system could enhance compliance with renewable energy targets, increase the use of biomass from wildfire-prone areas, and provide a transparent audit trail. Key system recommendations, including modular system architecture, mobile data capture, and automated reporting, aim to reduce administrative overhead and improve regulatory efficiency.

# **Introduction** {#introduction}

This project aims to develop recommendations for a comprehensive Biomass Tracking System for the State of California, addressing the perceived need for an efficient chain-of-custody (CoC) system to track forest biomass from its source to its final use. The initiative was prompted by the recognition that existing biomass tracking methods in California are fragmented, labor-intensive, and often paper-based, resulting in inefficiencies, compliance challenges, and limited transparency. Current approaches lack real-time, auditable data and impose significant administrative burdens on biomass producers, processors, and regulatory agencies. Undertaken by Carbon Direct in partnership with multiple California state agencies, this project provides recommendations for the development of a modern, interoperable CoC system that supports transparent and streamlined biomass tracking across the state.

The study rests on several key assumptions about the role of biomass in California. First, it assumes that forest biomass will continue to play an important role in the state’s bioenergy and biofuel production mix in the foreseeable future. Second, it assumes that public, private, and tribal stakeholders will adopt a new tracking system if it demonstrably reduces compliance burdens or improves operational outcomes. Lastly, it assumes that state and federal policies will continue to evolve, increasingly requiring verifiable CoC systems to meet regulatory and sustainability goals.

The central hypothesis of this project is that a unified, standards-based digital CoC system can significantly reduce compliance costs, improve data accuracy, and build stakeholder trust across the biomass supply chain. The project seeks to address the core problem of fragmented reporting systems and manual data reconciliation, which currently present challenges to compliance efforts and limit the efficiency of biomass utilization in the state.

This work builds on established biomass certification systems and regulatory frameworks, as discussed in the following sections. While existing systems offer valuable models for traceability, their applicability to California’s unique wildfire mitigation, forestry, and bioenergy landscape remains limited.

# **Materials and Methods** {#materials-and-methods}

The project employed a multi-method approach to balance technical rigor with practical applicability. It began with a meta-analysis of existing biomass tracking systems and CoC models, including a comprehensive review of relevant national and international policies and standards. Concurrently, a detailed assessment of existing regulatory programs and reporting requirements was completed, incorporating feedback from agency staff, to identify key gaps and areas for improvement in California’s biomass tracking landscape. 

To ensure the recommendations reflected real-world needs, the project team carried out structured stakeholder interviews with representatives from California state agencies, industry, tribal communities, and non-governmental organizations. These interviews helped uncover operational challenges and supply chain constraints critical to the system’s design. 

Drawing on these findings, the team developed recommendations for a scalable and adaptable biomass tracking system tailored to California’s context. The proposed system recommendations were shared with stakeholders and agency representatives for feedback to validate alignment with both technical requirements and the practical realities of implementation.

# **Results** {#results}

The proposed recommendations for a standards-based, digital CoC system address stakeholder concerns around cost, complexity, and compliance burdens. Stakeholder interviews underscored that a unified data standard and streamlined reporting processes could potentially improve traceability without increasing transaction costs, thereby encouraging market adoption. Compared to existing frameworks such as the Forest Stewardship Council, Sustainable Biomass Program, and The International Sustainability and Carbon Certification, the proposed system offers greater flexibility for managing mixed feedstocks, which are prevalent in California’s biomass markets. It also enhances digital traceability to meet California-specific regulatory and wildfire mitigation needs, and is designed for better alignment with the state’s Low-Carbon Fuels Standard, BioMAT, and BioRAM programs, providing stronger integration than most international standards. 

If implemented, this system could:

* Improve compliance with California’s renewable energy and carbon reduction mandates,  
* Enable increased utilization of biomass from wildfire hazard zones, thereby helping to reduce forest fire risks, and  
* Establish a transparent audit trail, supporting lifecycle CO2 emissions and sustainable sourcing claims

Recommendation innovations include:

* A modular, interoperable data architecture capable of supporting a wide range of users, including mills, haulers, and tribal entities,  
* Mobile-first, offline-capable tools to streamline field data capture, and  
* Automated compliance reporting, aligned with the data requirements of multiple regulatory programs

While detailed cost modeling was beyond the scope of this project, qualitative feedback from stakeholders indicates that a unified biomass tracking system would likely reduce administrative burdens for market participants, potentially lowering compliance costs when compared to current fragmented and duplicative tracking methods.

## Summary of Relevant Programs and Certifications  {#summary-of-relevant-programs-and-certifications}

### Introduction

A CoC system is the set of rules, records, and verification steps that keep the identity and sustainability attributes of a product intact as it moves from its point of origin to its final customer. CoC systems are typically built around one of three models: physical segregation, where certified material is kept completely separate from non-certified material; mass-balance (credit or percentage) systems, which allow mixing but require strict input/output accounting so that certified outputs never exceed certified inputs; and book and claim, where physical product flows and sustainability attributes are decoupled and certified attributes are traded digitally through a registry.

Numerous policies, at the state, federal and/or national-level, impact the design of CoC systems. At the same time, there are several existing biomass certification and CoC systems. This section summarizes several international frameworks, state policies, United States federal policies, and international policies and their interaction with CoC systems. We conclude with an identification of priority attributes to be included in a potential CoC system. 

**Key terms**

* **Chain of Custody (CoC) system:** A system of rules, records, and verification steps that tracks materials and their sustainability attributes as they move through the supply chain, ensuring claims about certified content are credible.  
* **Physical segregation (identity preservation):** A CoC model where certified and non-certified materials are kept fully separate at all stages of processing and transport. This provides the highest level of traceability but often requires parallel infrastructure to prevent mixing.  
* **Mass balance:** An umbrella term for CoC models that allow mixing of certified and non-certified materials but require strict input/output accounting to ensure certified outputs never exceed certified inputs over a defined scope (batch, product line, or timeframe).  
  * **Percentage-based system:** A type of mass balance system. Certified output reflects the proportion of certified input in a defined batch or time period. There is no carry-over of credits, output claims are directly tied to input ratios.   
  * **Credit system:** A type of mass balance system. Certified inputs generate “credits” that can be banked and later assigned to outputs, allowing flexibility in when and where certification claims are applied. This requires precise conversion factors and robust documentation.  
* **Book-and-claim system:** A CoC model where physical product flows and sustainability attributes are decoupled. Certified attributes are traded digitally through a registry, enabling sustainability claims without tracking physical materials. Common in energy markets (e.g., RECs) and biofuels (e.g., RSB Book & Claim).  
* **Batch-level traceability:** Traceability where certification claims apply to a defined production batch. All certified inputs and outputs are linked for that batch only.  
* **Lot-level traceability:** A finer-grained version of batch traceability where certification claims are tracked for each lot or unit of production, allowing for higher precision and accountability.  
* **Controlled wood:** A category of material allowed in Forest Stewardship Certification (FSC) “Mix” products that is not FSC certified but has been assessed as low risk of coming from unacceptable sources (e.g., illegally harvested or violating human rights). Controlled Wood helps prevent controversial material from entering certified supply chains.

### International Frameworks

#### **The Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP)**

##### **Background**

The Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP) is a voluntary certification system designed to ensure that woody biomass used in bioenergy meets defined sustainability standards, supports greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, and maintains supply chain transparency. SBP certification covers the entire supply chain, from feedstock sourcing through to energy production, ensuring legal compliance, sustainable harvesting, and biodiversity protection. It aligns with major regulatory frameworks such as the EU RED II and III, EU Delegated Regulation (EU DR), and national biomass sustainability schemes (*e.g.*, the Netherlands’ SDE+ and Japan’s requirements).

SBP defines eligible biomass materials as woody biomass, including wood pellets, chips, and processing residues. Acceptable feedstock sources span forests, trees outside forests (TOF), agricultural residues, and post-consumer wood. 

SBP compliance requirements include standards for sustainable sourcing, risk assessment, and mitigation. Certification requires that biomass be legally and sustainably sourced, with no mixing allowed between certified and non-certified woody biomass. A risk-based approach is used to classify sourcing areas as low or specified risk. Where risks are identified, Risk Management Plans (RMPs) must be implemented. Environmental risk assessments also examine biodiversity, soil health, and carbon stock impacts. These measures are evaluated annually to ensure effectiveness and adapt to evolving risks.

SBP sustainability criteria focus heavily on GHG emissions and forest integrity. The certification includes requirements for biogenic emissions accounting and both historical and projected carbon stock and sink estimates. Biomass harvesting must avoid net carbon loss, and all carbon savings and emissions reductions must be verifiable. Forest biomass must also meet requirements for legal harvesting, regeneration, and biodiversity conservation—criteria are increasingly important in EU policy. 

##### **CoC specifications**

SBP’s chain of custody (CoC) and traceability system is built on a mass balance approach to ensure that certified volumes are accurately tracked and overclaiming is avoided. Physical separation of certified and non-certified biomass is required for identity preservation. Organizations certified under FSC or PEFC must maintain a combined mass balance and credit ledger to meet SBP requirements. SBP-compliant and SBP-controlled biomass can be mixed, and non-woody biomass can be included if accurately tracked. However, certified woody biomass cannot be mixed with non-certified woody feedstock, or SBP claims will be invalidated. 

Robust tracking and verification systems support the SBP framework. This includes third-party audits, internal audits, Supply Base Evaluations (SBE) for feedstock risk assessment, and multiple Means of Verification (MoV), such as supplier audits and carbon accounting verification. The Data Transfer System (DTS) ensures secure digital tracking of transactions through unique IDs, and records must be kept for at least five years. Certified entities must be able to trace each transaction to their direct supplier and customer, ensuring accountability while the material is under their legal ownership. Outputs must not exceed inputs within a 12-month balancing period, separate mass balances are required per product group, and any negative balances must be immediately reported.

#### **Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)**

##### **Background**

The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) is a global certification system that facilitates  the traceability and sustainability of timber and non-timber forest products through certification, verification, and tracking standards. As of 2019, California had over 1.7 million acres certified under FSC, out of approximately 32 million acres of timberland.[^1] Globally, the system is extensive, covering millions of acres and engaging with stakeholders across all continents.

FSC certification operates under two complementary frameworks: Forest Management and CoC. The Forest Management certification is for forest owners and managers, and ensures the forest itself is managed responsibly. The CoC certification is the relevant standard for tracking forest-derived products through all stages of processing and trade. It applies to organizations worldwide that handle FSC-claimed inputs and includes certified, recycled, partially certified, and controlled non-certified content. FSC 100, FSC Recycled, and FSC Mix are the three certification labels, with FSC 100 maintaining the highest standards of origin and biodiversity protection, and FSC Mix offering operational flexibility through credit systems.

##### **CoC Specifications**

CoC within FSC supports three system designs: physical separation, percentage-based, and credit accounting models. Physical separation offers the highest traceability by keeping certified and non-certified content strictly apart but is operationally intensive. The percentage method enables facilities to certify products based on a rolling average of inputs, provided a minimum of 70% is FSC certified. The credit system allows more flexible allocation of certified volumes based on accumulated input credits but requires robust internal accounting systems. This variety in CoC design allows FSC to serve both high-integrity traceability needs and operational pragmatism for mixed-input facilities.

From a system-design perspective, FSC incorporates both geolocation and transaction monitoring through GeoJSON uploads and FSC Trace—a blockchain-enabled platform for digital data exchange. Certification bodies are responsible for collecting and auditing data and must retain records for a minimum of five years, while third parties must maintain documentation for seven. Key traceability information includes production, sales, training, and approvals, with options for spreadsheet and API-based reporting directly into FSC's digital system.

FSC’s interoperability with other frameworks is a growing focus. Its tools are already aligned with EU-DR requirements, particularly in traceability, legality, and documentation. However, a noted gap is the lack of up-to-date regional guidance outside of the EU context. 

For a tracking system, FSC presents a well-developed, flexible architecture that supports multiple CoC models, digital traceability infrastructure, risk-based assessments, and integration potential with deforestation-free requirements such as those outlined in the EUDR. A system seeking to align with FSC would need to support varied segregation and accounting mechanisms, facilitate document retention and auditability, and allow modular digital reporting functions that accommodate different levels of supply chain complexity.

#### **Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI)**

##### **Background**

The Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) is a North American forest certification program focused on protecting ecosystems, supporting sustainable purchasing practices, and empowering informed sourcing decisions. The SFI framework has certified over 350 million acres of forestland across the United States and Canada.[^2] In California alone, over 2.5 million acres are certified. SFI provides three primary certification programs: Forest Management, Fiber Sourcing, and CoC, each with distinct objectives and scopes. Forest Management applies only to forests in the U.S. and Canada and ensures practices that protect water quality, biodiversity, and wildlife habitat. The Fiber Sourcing Standard focuses on elevating procurement practices on uncertified lands and is applicable to any organization sourcing domestically or globally for North American facilities. The CoC Standard applies to organizations that source, process, or trade forest-based products and aim to track the movement of forest fiber from production to the final product.

##### **CoC Specifications**

The SFI CoC Standard intersects with traceability systems by requiring all certified entities to manage certified content through one of three methods: physical separation, percentage method, or credit method. Physical separation entails keeping certified material apart from non-certified input using spatial or temporal segregation, offering the highest traceability but with a higher operational burden. The percentage method allows mixing certified and non-certified inputs, so long as at least 70% of the content is certified over a product group or time period. The credit method lets certified input generate credits that can be assigned to product outputs, with credits valid for up to 24 months. Regardless of the model used, CoC requirements include detailed documentation, record retention for at least three years, and clearly defined procedures for verifying supplier claims and certified content. Certification is reinforced through annual audits and risk assessments.

From a system-design standpoint, a CoC platform aligning with SFI must support multiple tracking models (physical, percentage, credit), accommodate dynamic credit account management, and enable flexible product grouping (by species, site, or time). Although digital storage is not mandated under SFI, the system should still facilitate structured digital recordkeeping and allow for document uploads and internal audits. Interoperability is another key design requirement, as SFI CoC certification is compatible with ISO and PEFC systems and recognizes Canadian-specific certifications like CSA-Z809. Notably, SFI does not require blockchain or digital identity tools and lacks encryption standards for stored data, so an advanced system might provide optional enhancements in those areas. Lastly, global application of the CoC standard is supported, but forest management certification is strictly limited to U.S. and Canadian contexts, meaning that traceability rules may need to accommodate stricter auditing standards for operations sourcing from outside North America.

#### **Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC)**

##### **Background**

The Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) is a global certification system that promotes sustainable forest management through third-party certification. It is the largest forest certification program in the world by area and spans the full biomass supply chain, offering certifications in Sustainable Forest Management (SFM), Group Forest Management (GFM), and Chain of Custody (CoC). PEFC-certified biomass is recognized by international frameworks such as the EU Renewable Energy Directive II and RED III, the UK Timber Regulation, and the U.S. Lacey Act. It applies to a wide range of eligible materials including roundwood, fuelwood, sawnwood, pulp and paper, engineered wood products, and various non-wood forest products like cork and essential oils.

To qualify as certified, materials must be traceable and meet sustainability requirements including protection of biodiversity, preservation of High Conservation Value forests, enhancement of forest protective functions (e.g., water and soil retention), and adherence to labor rights as outlined in International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions. The standard explicitly prohibits genetically modified organisms and restricts sourcing from ecologically harmful or conflict regions. 

##### **CoC Specifications**

A CoC system designed to meet PEFC requirements must support physical separation or credit-based allocation models, ensuring certified and non-certified materials are not mixed in ways that compromise traceability. Participants must maintain documentation at each supply chain step, including invoices, flow descriptions, and sales records. The system must also accommodate supplier certifications and claims verification, whereby suppliers provide documented proof that inputs meet PEFC standards. Third-party auditing is mandatory and occurs on a rolling basis: initial audits, annual surveillance, and full re-certification every five years. These audits must comply with ISO standards and cover all entities involved in high-risk material flows. 

#### **Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB)**

##### **Background**

The Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) is a global sustainability certification system focused on the production, processing, and trade of bio-based, advanced, and circular products. It was developed to ensure that materials derived from biomass are produced in a way that safeguards environmental integrity, promotes social responsibility, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. RSB certification spans multiple market contexts through both voluntary and regulatory schemes. These include fuel-specific frameworks for the EU RED, Japan’s FIT program, and ICAO’s CORSIA standard, as well as voluntary certification for advanced fuels, advanced products, and smallholder-inclusive models. Participating Operators (POs) in the RSB system range from biomass producers and processors to traders and transport providers. Each operator type must implement RSB standards across all activities listed within their certified scope.

RSB certification is built around a 12-principle framework that governs legal compliance, GHG emissions reductions, food security, human and labor rights, rural development, land rights, biodiversity, soil and water conservation, and continuous improvement. The certification process includes application, pre-audit preparation, an on-site audit by an approved certification body, and ongoing surveillance and re-certification. The system offers modularity, allowing operators to layer on additional certifications—for example, demonstrating non-GMO cultivation, low indirect land use change (iLUC) risk, or specific environmental impacts such as water and soil conservation. This flexibility makes RSB adaptable to a range of bioeconomy stakeholders while maintaining high standards of environmental and social accountability.

##### **CoC Specifications** 

RSB integrates Chain of Custody (CoC) tracking as a core component of its sustainability assurance. The standard offers three CoC models: physical segregation, mass balance, and book-and-claim. Physical segregation provides the highest traceability, while the mass balance model allows for mixing of certified and non-certified materials within set operational limits, as long as outputs do not exceed inputs over a defined timeframe. Book and claim trading is also supported under a separate certification, enabling traceability through a digital registry even when physical tracking is impractical. Regardless of the model, operators must document and verify all transactions, transfers, and sustainability claims in alignment with the RSB CoC Procedure. Auditable records must be maintained for a minimum period, and CoC certification is a prerequisite for all POs that process or trade biomass or bio-based materials within the RSB system.

Designing a CoC system compatible with RSB requires support for recordkeeping, transaction monitoring, and traceability across both physical and digital flows. The system must be able to handle multiple types of operators and transaction points—such as first collectors, mechanical operators, and distributors—and support auditable accounting. For mass balance systems, this includes establishing clear conversion factors, defining credit periods, and enabling credit allocation across multiple products. Traceability documentation must be structured to align with certification body expectations and should support digital data exchange, including API or spreadsheet uploads. For advanced integration, the system should be compatible with the RSB Book & Claim Registry, which facilitates traceability for complex or disaggregated supply chains. The RSB framework emphasizes continuous improvement, and as such, system features should also support the inclusion of new data modules over time

### California Policies

#### **California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS)**

##### **Background**

California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) is a California policy aimed at reducing the carbon intensity (CI) of transportation fuels. As part of recently adopted amendments, the LCFS includes specific requirements for forest biomass used as a feedstock in fuel production. A phased implementation of CoC and sustainability standards is planned for 2026, 2028, and 2031\. These requirements vary depending on whether the biomass is “source-specified” or “non-specified source,” each of which carries distinct criteria and documentation expectations.

Source-specified forest biomass is defined as waste biomass collected from non-industrial forestlands primarily for wildfire fuel reduction, forest restoration, or public safety. This biomass must come from treatments where no clear cutting occurred and must comply with all local, state, and federal laws. Examples include small-diameter, non-merchantable residues such as branches and understory vegetation that do not meet regional commercial standards. Non-specified source forest biomass, in contrast, refers broadly to forest biomass without a narrowly defined source category. This biomass must originate from land cleared before January 1, 2008, that has remained managed or fallow since. The feedstock must be produced in accordance with best environmental practices that reduce GHG emissions or enhance sequestration, and must comply with relevant local, state, and federal regulations. Starting in 2026, producers must submit geographical plot data and attestation letters to the California Air Resources Board (CARB). By 2028, continuous third-party certification will be required, with certification systems either approved by the Executive Officer or recognized under EU RED criteria. Full sustainability and certification compliance will be required by 2031\.

##### **CoC Specifications**

CoC system design under LCFS includes several key components. A mass or energy balance system must be implemented to trace the assignment of feedstock attributes from input to output across the supply chain. Delivery records must be maintained to document shipment details, including type, quantity, and origin. CARB requires open access to operational and documentation systems for third-party verifiers and CARB staff to ensure compliance with certified CI values and sustainability claims. 

For source-specified forest biomass, CoC requirements include maintaining delivery records, material or energy balance data, and supporting documentation such as feedstock transfer records and a signed attestation letter. These systems must enable auditors to verify that the feedstock aligns with its claimed sustainability and CI attributes.

For non-specified source forest biomass, CoC documentation will become progressively stringent over the phase-in period. Beginning in 2028, continuous third-party certification will be required, and CoC records must include certificates identifying biomass volume or mass from the first gathering point to the fuel producer. By 2031, full CoC compliance will be necessary to support sustainability and certification claims.

Design implications for CoC compliance under LCFS include the need for robust digital infrastructure to manage balance systems and traceability, coordination with third-party certification programs, and integration of field-level data (*e.g.*, geolocation) with transactional documentation. Programs must be flexible enough to meet varying timelines and definitions while maintaining full audit readiness and recordkeeping for all relevant feedstock attributes.

#### **The Bioenergy Market Adjusting Tariff (BioMAT)**

##### **Background**

BioMAT is a California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) program established under SB 1122 (Rubio) in 2012 to incentivize small-scale bioenergy production. It requires California’s investor-owned utilities (IOUs), and later Community Choice Aggregators (CCAs), to collectively procure at least 250 MW of renewable electricity from qualifying bioenergy facilities. Of this, 50 MW must come specifically from facilities using byproducts of sustainable forest management, with an emphasis on reducing wildfire risk. Eligible facilities are capped at 3 MW net capacity and must have commenced operation after June 1, 2013\.

Despite the program’s clear goals, project implementation has been limited, with only a handful of facilities (*e.g.*, Collins Pine in Chester, California, and Hat Creek Bioenergy in Burney, California) brought online to date. CPUC has issued multiple decisions (D.14-12-081, D.17-08-021, D.20-08-043, and D.23-11-084) refining the program, and is currently exploring stronger third-party verification protocols under Rulemaking R.18-07-003 to improve trust and accountability in feedstock sourcing.

BioMAT defines qualifying biomass as byproducts of sustainable forest management, including logging slash, forest thinning, mill waste, and shrub removal, especially from “Fire Threat Treatment Areas,” which encompass nearly all forested regions in California. Eligible activities include fire threat reduction, fire-safe clearance, infrastructure protection, and broader sustainable forest management. CAL FIRE, which developed the foundational criteria, requires projects to complete a “Forest Biomass Sustainability” form aligned with 16 sustainability criteria (12 of which must be met), and the CPUC has adopted this process with minimal modifications.

##### **CoC Specifications**

CoC and monitoring expectations under BioMAT are still evolving but include three core components:

* Certification by a Registered Professional Forester or equivalent official,  
* Verification by the facility operator using trip tickets or load documentation to confirm feedstock origin and sustainability attributes, and  
* Monitoring, enforced through random audits based on a rolling 5-year average.

These requirements imply an emerging CoC framework that is not yet formalized into digital or mass balance systems. As discussions continue, establishing a consistent, auditable CoC standard, potentially through shared data protocols, could enhance BioMAT’s implementation and provide clearer pathways for verifying compliance with sustainability goals.

#### **Bioenergy Renewable Auction Mechanism (BioRAM)**

##### **Background**

BioRAM is a CPUC initiative created in response to the 2016 Governor’s Tree Mortality Emergency Proclamation. Its goal is to mitigate wildfire risk by directing investor-owned utilities (IOUs) to procure electricity from bioenergy facilities that utilize forest biomass from high-risk areas. BioRAM focuses on biomass sourced from high hazard zones (HHZs) and sustainably managed forests (SFM), using an auction-based procurement structure to support energy production from these sources.

The program has evolved through a series of legislative actions: SB 859 (2016) initially required IOUs to procure fuel from HHZs; SB 901 (2018) added flexibility and extended some contracts beyond five years; SB 1109 (2022) further extended eligible contracts up to 15 years; and AB 2750 (2024) most recently allowed contract extensions through 2033\. Several bioenergy facilities participate in the program, including Rio Bravo Fresno, Honey Lake Power, and Shasta Sustainable Resource Management.

Feedstock sourcing under BioRAM is strictly defined and tracked. Facilities must meet minimum thresholds for fuel sourced from sustainable forest management (80%) and from high hazard zones (60%). HHZs are defined by CAL FIRE using Tier 1 and Tier 2 designations that prioritize areas where tree mortality and community infrastructure risks overlap. Forest management practices under SFM include removing dead or dying trees from HHZs, but exclude clear-cut areas. Specific timber operation exemptions under California Public Resources Code allow feedstock to be sourced from non-HHZ areas under certain fuel reduction purposes.

Data tracking is central to BioRAM compliance. Facilities are required to submit quarterly reports documenting HHZ feedstock volumes, permit numbers, GPS coordinates, and the percentage of each load derived from Tier 1/Tier 2 HHZs, SFM, or other exemptions. There is also a monthly compliance option, where facilities submit attestations indicating whether mandated sourcing levels were met. If a facility falls short of demonstrating compliance, the energy generated is compensated at an alternative price point, creating a financial incentive to comply. Annual audits by IOUs verify the total HHZ feedstock used each year, with collected data feeding into statewide metrics tracked by CPUC.

##### **CoC specifications**

Implications for CoC system design include a strong emphasis on geolocation, load-level tracking, and a blend of reporting modalities (attestations, audits, and map-based records). While not a formal mass balance system, BioRAM has developed a functional hybrid model of physical traceability and regulatory oversight that could be further enhanced by digitized CoC standards. Given the volume of fuel and the complexity of sourcing areas, BioRAM’s evolving tracking architecture offers valuable lessons for future policy-aligned CoC systems.

#### **California Forest Practice Act**

##### **Background**

The Z’Berg Neredly Forest Practice Act, enacted in 1973, led to the creation of the California Board of Forestry & Fire Protection and tasked the board with creating rules known as the Forest Practice Rules, to govern timber operations on state and private lands in California.  The purpose of the law is to “achieve maximum sustained production of high quality timber products while giving consideration to values relating to recreation, watershed, wildlife, range and forage, fisheries, regional economic vitality, employment and aesthetic enjoyment” (Public Resource Code §4513b).  The Forest Practice Act is enforced by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) and regulates the size and location of harvest areas,and provides protection measures for riparian corridors, geologic sensitive areas, archeologic sites, wildlife, botanical resources and timing of operations. 

Any harvesting of logs offered for sale, barter, exchange, trade or as part of a conversion from timberland to nontimberland use requires a permit pursuant to the California Forest Practice Act.  The main permit type is a Timber Harvesting Plan (THP), which allows for a single timber harvest; there are also Non-Industrial Timber Management Plan (NTMP) and a Working Forest Management Plan (WFMP) for ownerships less than 2,500 and 10,000 acres respectively as well as exemptions which apply to specific circumstances.    

Registered Professional Foresters (RPFs) prepare THPs which are then submitted to CAL FIRE and undergo a multidisciplinary review prior to approval by the Director. The THP process has been certified as “Functionally Equivalent” to an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) as required by CEQA. As part of the functional equivalency, THPs include a cumulative impacts assessment where the Project assesses if there will be significant adverse effects to the resources including: watershed, soil productivity, biological, recreation, visual, traffic, greenhouse gases, wildfire risk and hazard impacts. The multidisciplinary review process includes agency members from CAL FIRE, Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB), California Geological Service (CGS), and in certain scenarios the review team can include the county, Coastal Commission, Department of Parks and Recreation or other relevant agencies. THPs are valid for five years and may be extended by two years for a total of seven years. NTMP and WFMP are living documents that do not expire.  

Special circumstances that are exempt from the preparation of a Timber Harvest Plan include: harvesting christmas trees, or dead, dying or diseased fuelwood trees at less than 10 percent of the average volume per acre, 150’ and 300’ structure protection exemptions, less than 3 acre conversion, drought mortality, oak woodland restoration and forest resilience exemption.  The Forest Resilience Exemption was recently introduced by the Board of Forestry to allow landowners to harvest trees to eliminate the vertical and horizontal continuity of vegetative fuels and to reduce flammable materials to reduce fire spread, duration and intensity, fuel ignitability, or ignition of tree crowns.

##### **CoC Specifications**

THPs and permits prepared under the California Forest Practice Act do not have CoC requirements; however, CAL FIRE maintains a robust database of submitted and approved permits (available through CALTREES) and the spatial data (available on the CAL FIRE Forest Practice GIS hub) including the boundaries and silvicultural prescription are also readily available.  

**California Senate Bill 498 Reporting**

##### **Background**

California’s Senate Bill 498 (SB 498), enacted in 2014 and authored by Senator Ricardo Lara, is a California law that revised the definition of "biomass conversion" and established specific annual reporting requirements for biomass conversion facilities. The primary purpose of SB 498, as it pertains to these facilities, is to require owners or operators to provide an annual report to the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) by April 1st of each year, covering the preceding year's operations. This report must detail various aspects of the materials handled by the facility. Biomass conversion itself involves the production of heat, fuels, or electricity using controlled combustion or other noncombustion thermal technologies on specific separated materials like agricultural crop residues, wood waste, and nonrecyclable paper materials. The annual reporting requirement started for the 2015 report year.

##### **CoC Specifications**

The requirements of SB 498 inherently intersect with the principles of CoC because the law mandates tracking and reporting the flow of materials into and out of the facility. Specifically, the annual report requires detailed information about the sources of accepted materials, the types and amounts of materials accepted, the types and amounts of rejected materials and the reasons for rejection, the sources of rejected materials, and the end users of ash and other byproducts. To accurately compile this information for the annual report, facilities need a system in place to track materials from their origin, through the facility (acceptance/rejection), and to their final disposition (processing or byproduct end use). While the law doesn't explicitly mandate a specific CoC technology, the reporting requirements necessitate a robust internal tracking mechanism that functions as a form of chain of custody for biomass materials.

For a CoC system to meet the specific requirements outlined in the SB 498 reporting form (CalRecycle 863), it would need to capture detailed information for each material load received and each byproduct batch sent offsite. Key design considerations include the ability to record the Material Type, the Tons Accepted (distinguishing bone dry or wet), and the Source Category (Urban, Agriculture, Mill Residue, or In-Forestry) for all accepted materials. Critically, for accepted materials, the system must also record the Name of the Source and its physical Address/Location, or a clear explanation if this information is unavailable (*e.g.*, "Material from various locations"). Similarly, the CoC system must track Rejected Material Types, Tons Rejected, and the Reason for rejection, along with the Name and physical Address/Location of the source of the rejected material, providing an explanation if source information is missing. Finally, for ash and other byproducts, the system must track the type of byproduct, the name of the end user, and their physical address/location.

Beyond capturing the individual transaction data, the CoC system design must facilitate the aggregation of this information annually to produce the required totals and lists for the SB 498 report. It should allow for reporting the total tons accepted and rejected by type, and compiling lists of all sources for accepted and rejected materials, as well as all end users for byproducts, including their locations. The system should also accommodate the distinction between bone dry and wet tons. While the sources mention that facilities may submit existing reports provided to other state agencies if they contain the required information, any missing details must be provided separately. Therefore, a comprehensive CoC system would ideally capture all data points mandated by PRC 44107(b) to streamline compliance.

### National and International Policies

#### **The Federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS)** 

##### **Background**

The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is a U.S. federal program established by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and expanded under the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007\. Administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Clean Air Act (CAA), RFS mandates increasing volumes of renewable fuels to replace or reduce petroleum-based fuels used in transportation, home heating oil, and jet fuel nationwide. RFS sets annual volume targets for renewable fuels in the United States. EPA determines these volume targets annually via rulemaking, guided by statutory considerations such as consumer costs, impacts on job creation, agricultural commodity prices, rural economic development, and food prices.

RFS utilizes a market-based credit system involving Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs). RINs are generated with each gallon of qualifying renewable fuel produced or imported into the U.S. Obligated Parties (refiners/importers of gasoline and diesel) must annually retire sufficient RINs to satisfy their Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs). RVOs are calculated annually by multiplying each obligated party’s gasoline and diesel production/import volume by EPA-established percentage standards, adjusted for any carry-over deficits from previous years. Excess RINs can be traded, creating a credit market. Non-obligated third parties such as brokers and traders can participate. Unfulfilled RVOs result in compliance deficits, which must be reconciled in the following year, with no further deficit carry-over permitted. Exporters of renewable fuels must fully satisfy obligations within the compliance year; deficit carry-over is not allowed for exporters.

RFS sustainability criteria focus on: 1\) compliance with the definition of “renewable biomass,” and 2\) achieving required lifecycle GHG emissions reductions. Under the RFS, renewable fuels must demonstrate lifecycle GHG emissions reductions compared to a 2005 petroleum baseline. Innovative pathways without established CI defaults require submission of a formal RFS petition to EPA. Review time varies with analytical complexity and petition completeness. The EPA’s pathway approval serves as the formal regulatory certification. Upon approval, EPA assigns a specific pathway and D-code eligibility, authorizing the company to generate RINs without additional certification, provided it continues meeting EPA registration, reporting, and auditing standards.

Under the RFS, independent third-party verification is essential for ensuring Renewable Identification Number (RIN) integrity and compliance. Key verification measures include:

* **Annual compliance audits**: Renewable fuel producers must undergo annual attest audits by independent auditors. Auditors verify RIN generation accuracy, feedstock documentation, and facility records.  
* **Mass balance verification**: Independent auditors must submit mass balance reports for facilities each quarter, ensuring RIN validity.

Qualification as “renewable biomass” is currently unsettled for forest biomass feedstocks. To date, no fuels from forest biomass have been sold under the RFS. The RFS, as updated in Sec. 201 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-140), defines “renewable biomass” to include “Planted trees and tree residue from actively managed tree plantations on non-federal land cleared at any time prior to enactment of this sentence…” as well as “Slash and pre-commercial thinnings that are from non-federal forestlands.” 

The definition of renewable biomass generally excludes fiber from federal forestlands. There are, however, exemptions for “Biomass obtained from the immediate vicinity of buildings and other areas regularly occupied by people, or of public infrastructure, at risk from wildfire” on federal lands, and on forestlands belonging to American Indian tribes.  

Recent collaboration between the US Forest Service and US EPA has clarified current knowledge on RFS-compliant federal feedstocks, with implications for this project. Numerous questions remain about implementation. To address these issues, Strategic Biofuels worked with the US Forest Service and EPA to develop a “[Practical Guide to Forestry Feedstock under the Renewable Fuel Standard](https://strategicbiofuels.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Practical-Guide-to-Forestry-Feedstock-under-the-Renewable-Fuel-Standard-Sept-2024.pdf),” which we summarize below.

There are several kinds of forest biomass that are likely disqualified from the RFS, even from private timberland. For example, if the woody biomass is “slash” from federal forests, or slash from plantation or natural forests that do not meet the qualification requirements under the RFS regulations, it is not usable under the RFS.

For virtually all forest feedstock, a management plan or timber harvest plan is required to clearly document the intent for removal of the material from the tract. The EPA expects and assumes that the removal of feedstock from the forest is incidental to normal forestry management and does not change or drive forest management practices.

* **Logging**: Currently, for forest biomass materials to be considered qualified feedstock, they must be generated from logging operations or from downstream lumber processing or wood product manufacturing. These materials could be whole trees (“pre-commercial thinnings”) or slash generated from logging. Slash that has accumulated in a forest as a result of a storm, wildfire, or similar disturbance is not currently usable as the EPA is having internal discussions related to this material.  
* **Qualified feedstock**: Per the RFS regulations, qualified feedstock can take the form of slash, thinnings, or milling or manufacturing residues. Slash and thinnings are relatively straightforward in terms of qualification, however milling or manufacturing residue, particularly sawmill waste — as a significant subset of residue — has unique challenges to use due to the potential for incoming RFS-qualified raw material to be mixed with non-RFS-qualified material during the storage and/or milling processes, and traceability concerns.  
* **Areas at risk of wildfire**: Wood from federal and non-federal lands is allowable under the “area” at risk of wildfire” renewable biomass category; however, this wood cannot practically be used at this time because it is not included in the existing RFS pathways. A new facility-specific pathway petition would have to be filed with and approved by the EPA prior to being able to use this material.  
* **Tribal lands**: Based on a recent EPA ruling, wood from Tribal lands may be usable under the RFS program.

##### **CoC Specifications**

The RFS0801 (“RFS Renewable Biomass Report”)[^3]  is a quarterly report that is submitted by RIN generators. Submitters report supplemental feedstock information for feedstocks used to produce renewable fuel and generate RINs under the RFS. The information contained in RFS0801 could be included as part of a CoC system.

### Priority Attributes

There is a vast amount of data already collected by existing programs, policies, and certifications for forest biomass. All of these could potentially be transmitted by a CoC system. However a well-designed system should prioritize the most important data that could be transmitted. 

Carbon Direct believes the most relevant policies and certifications are 1\) those impacting existing and future biopower and biofuel producers using forest biomass from California, and 2\) existing certification programs that have built CoC systems. From this list, we have identified priority attributes for a potential CoC system based on each program’s data requirements. Priority attributes are shown in Appendix A, listed by each relevant policy and/or certification.

## Summary of Interviews {#summary-of-interviews}

### Introduction

Carbon Direct conducted a series of 45-minute virtual interviews with key stakeholders, including federal and state agencies, certification bodies, industry operators, logistics providers, and civil society groups, to inform the design of an effective biomass CoC system. These interviews aimed to surface operational challenges, reporting gaps, and real-world constraints, ensuring that our CoC framework would meet both regulatory requirements and user needs.  
Interviews proceeded in three steps: (1) stakeholder mapping and prioritization in collaboration with the Interagency Group; (2) six agency focus-group sessions and 19 structured interviews involving 25 participants (see Table XX for a full listing of individuals interviewed, their organizations, and stakeholder group categorizations); and (3) thematic synthesis of transcript data to identify priority system attributes. Feedback was aggregated across stakeholder categories to reveal common challenges and opportunities.

### Stakeholder Profiles

To inform the CoC system design, stakeholders were grouped not solely by organizational affiliation but by the functional role they play across the biomass supply chain, reporting ecosystem, and policy landscape. Interviewees were assigned to categories based on the nature of their insights and responsibilities, whether they emphasized operational logistics, certification frameworks, regulatory reporting, data sovereignty, or system architecture. For example, while several participants represented forestry companies, those participants focused on harvest logistics and mill operations were grouped under B*iomass Supply-Chain Experts*, while those navigating multiple certification regimes were grouped within *Biomass Certification & Operations Experts*.

This thematic approach ensured that feedback was synthesized around common challenges and priorities, such as data reconciliation, reporting burden, or technology adoption readiness. It also allowed the analysis to distinguish between field-level, administrative, and policy-level perspectives, supporting a balanced and implementation-focused design.

### Summary of Recommendations from Interviews

**Implement an integrated, standards-based data architecture**: A single, standard way to format biomass data is critically needed, supported by readily available connectors to key systems (like CAL FIRE's THP database or SBP’s DTS) and utilizing application programming interface (APIs) for automatic data exchange. This standardized approach is essential for seamless data exchange across diverse stakeholders, including mills, haulers, Tribes, utilities, and state agencies, helping to avoid data inefficiencies and errors caused by fragmented systems and the complex regulatory environment. Certification managers, supply chain experts, reporting stakeholders, state agencies, and Tribes all highlighted the inefficiencies and burdens caused by a lack of uniform data standards and fragmented systems, reinforcing the need for a unified data architecture.

**Support end-to-end traceability and audit-ready lineage**: The system must automatically track inputs and outputs at every step to provide verifiable lineage and support audit requirements. Current reliance on paper tickets and manual data entry impedes efficient and accurate lineage tracking. Multiple overlapping regulations and increased audit scrutiny demand precise, easily accessible lineage information. An automated digital ledger is required to support robust audit trails, provide real-time reconciliation capabilities, and streamline compliance reporting by detailing biomass lineage (*e.g.*, source attribution like High Hazard Zone or silviculture type).

**Develop low-friction, mobile-first data capture tools**: Data capture should be optimized for field use with a mobile-first design that is easy to use and requires minimal friction for operators. Key features should include offline functionality for areas with limited connectivity, in-app validation using drop-down lists and built-in checks to catch errors immediately, and easy integration of photos and GPS coordinates tied directly to records. This approach addresses issues like high onboarding friction with complex systems, connectivity limitations in the field, and significant back-office overhead from manual data transcription errors.

**Enable automated compliance and market-ready reporting**: The system should provide automated features for generating required reports for various regulatory programs (*e.g.*,RFS, LCFS, BioRAM, BioMAT) and voluntary markets. This includes providing a library of report templates for major programs, implementing automated scheduling and alerts for deadlines, and standardizing data fields and inputs across compatible file types. Automated reporting is crucial to help stakeholders navigate the complexity of regulatory reporting requirements, handle program-specific validation rules, and alleviate deadline pressure, which currently leads to significant manual effort and potential errors or penalties.

**Focus development on the value proposition for adoption by biomass market participants:** The utility of a biomass CoC system in achieving regulatory and public good objectives (*e.g.*, climate change mitigation, healthy forests, economic development) is predicated on credible and extensive data captured through its use by market participants. The use of a CoC system by market participants must either materially reduce transaction costs or increase transaction value to drive adoption. 

**Implement robust data privacy**: Market participants are reluctant to share information regarding upstream suppliers, market characteristics (*e.g.*, prices, quantity, attributes), and customers. Similarly, regulatory agencies are reluctant to make public information that could materially impact public good objectives such as utility rates or stifle market efficiency. Without clear data privacy safeguards, voluntary adoption of a CoC system will be low and could prevent the CoC system from achieving its goals.

### Thematic Findings

#### Integrated, Standards-Based Data Architecture

An integrated, standards-based data architecture represents a unified data model accompanied by standardized interfaces, enabling seamless data exchange across diverse stakeholder groups involved in biomass supply chains, including mills, haulers, Tribes, utilities, and state agencies. By establishing a common data schema (*e.g.*, fields such as THP ID, species, volume, haul distance), stakeholders avoid redundant manual entries, reduce errors, and streamline regulatory compliance and reporting processes.

##### ***Cross-stakeholder key findings and CoC implications***

All stakeholder groups consistently identified fragmented, manual processes and siloed data systems as primary obstacles to efficient biomass tracking and compliance. Across certification experts, supply‐chain operators, reporting teams, Tribes, NGOs, and state agencies, participants described reliance on pen‐and‐paper tickets, disparate spreadsheets, and multiple regulatory portals, each with its own data definitions, which leads to duplicate entry, transcription errors, and excessive administrative burdens. In every context, interviewees emphasized that margins on biomass are razor-thin and that any new solution must reduce per-ton tracking costs; otherwise, operators will abandon piles rather than incur added paperwork. Moreover, all groups underscored the necessity of integrating existing data sources, whether Log Inventory & Management System (LIMS) platforms like Three-Log, GIS shapefiles, THP databases, or tribal co-stewardship records, into a single framework to avoid “one-off” manual data transfers and to ensure that data flows automatically between mills, haulers, Tribes, utilities, and regulatory entities.

##### ***Stakeholder-Specific Insights***

###### Biomass Certification & Operations Experts

Respondents frequently underlined that data is meaningless without standards, citing the shortcomings of the European Union Database for Biofuels (UDB) as a cautionary example. When first implemented, the UDB faced significant interoperability challenges, as inconsistent field definitions across platforms, nations and industries made data integration difficult. For example, required fields such as unique identifiers (*e.g.*, NTR ID or EIN) were often missing, preventing complete reporting. 

While improvements have been made over time, stakeholders emphasized that the EU’s struggle to define universally applicable standards illustrates the critical importance of establishing clear, interoperable data definitions early in system design. 

Additionally, participants  explained how they have to balance several certification programs, each with its own set of rules: FSC, SFI, PEFC, ISCC, and SBP. One participant noted that "we spend more time translating between auditor interpretations than actually tracking volume".Conflicting data requirements enforced by regulatory frameworks and certification programs like LCFS, RFS, FSC, and SBP exacerbate these different requirements. **Certification and operations experts concur that the non-negotiable basis is the establishment of basic data standards**. 

Concerning certification schemes, interviewees cautioned California to avoid the  EU’s mistakes, and instead utilize an API to collect data from existing schemes and integrate it into the state's system. Some respondents highlighted  that the Union Database struggles to establish communication channels amongst systems due to its complexity. Others  emphasized that any solution involving redundant data entry, such as duplicating logs, lumber, and vendor records already maintained in enterprise systems, would be met with immediate resistance. 

###### Biomass Supply-Chain Experts

Interviewees described a complex system of pen-and-paper tickets, spreadsheets, and multiple state portals that require coordination across numerous data sources during FSC audits or agency filings, and emphasized the need to centralize operations without exposing sensitive volumes. 

Participants noted that while power plants, pulp mills, and pellet mills store scale data in commercial log-accounting software like Three-Log, any new platform must integrate with their accounting systems to avoid being ignored. As one stakeholder put it, ***“if a new system doesn’t talk to these \[existing tools\], it’s dead on arrival”*** resonated with all participants due to feedstock margins near break-even. 

Stakeholders track biomass through a patchwork of pen-and-paper trip tickets, spreadsheets, and proprietary log systems, then re-key the same data into a half-dozen regulatory portals, CARB’s LCFS interface, CalRecycle’s RDRS, Energy Commission fuel reports, local air-district filings, and CPUC BioRAM spreadsheets. Stakeholders noted that , “plants use internal spreadsheets to generate reports for CARB, CalRecycle, and CEC,” which requires staff to reconcile the same data and increases error risk. 

Operators struggle to combine state, county, and federal permit and sourcing data, compounding this inefficiency. One stakeholder noted that CAL FIRE's portal works well for California, but “we have no equivalent system for federal or Oregon projects,” making permit tracking “inefficient and easy to lose track of.” 

Some interviewees shared that they had  developed an in-house solution to standardize data formats from scaling bureaus. Facilities must comply with various frameworks, including CARB's LCFS, CalRecycle's RDSS, CEC reports, PUC/BioRAM filings, BioMAT, RPS mandates, and internal accounting tools like Three-Log and Log Inventory & Management System (LIMS). Duplicate data entry and administrative burden result from complexity. 

For adoption, a new CoC system must be cost-effective by utilizing existing sources, minimizing duplicate steps, and reducing weigh-master or accounting time. Participants emphasized that  operators must be convinced that the system replaces existing systems before adopting it. Smooth data import, automated regulatory portal formatting, and tight integration with current tools can reduce overhead and meet stakeholders' practical needs. Without standards-based interoperability and manual reconciliation reductions, supply-chain experts say the solution will be “dead on arrival.”

###### Biomass Reporting Stakeholders 

Interviewees highlighted that fragmented, manual tracking processes impose an onerous administrative burden: “We report quarterly to PG\&E all of our sources and all of our volumes, and that’s a pretty onerous task… my assistant probably spends between half and two-thirds of his time just doing that”, according to one participant. 

Reporting stakeholders currently compile data from various sources (*e.g.*, THP documents, GIS outputs, truck tickets, Log Inventory & Management System (LIMS), spreadsheets, permit PDFs) through a manual process that can introduce errors and is inherently inefficient. One interviewee explained, “Current practices utilize LIMS system (3LOG) for detailed biomass sourcing tracking, including THP numbers, volumes, and locations,” yet those data still get re‑entered manually into PG\&E’s quarterly spreadsheet, an “unnecessary” duplication. 

To reduce this burden, stakeholders want to leverage existing sources (*e.g.*, THPs, environmental permits) rather than add new data‑entry requirements. They also prioritize integrating LCFS, RFS, and BioRAM contract data, amongst others prioritized policies and certifications, into a unified schema so users don’t translate between spreadsheets and agency portals. 

Finally, sensitive permit or residue data often live in siloed systems; a canonical reporting schema must accommodate both public and proprietary fields.

###### NGO and Tribal Community Stakeholders 

Biomass tracking today remains largely analog and fragmented. Field crews rely on paper scale and log tickets, manually transposing origin data, such as GIS coordinates and logging permits, along with weight information into Excel spreadsheets. While GIS shapefiles for permits and project areas do exist, they are not integrated into the load-ticket workflow, resulting in persistent disconnects between spatial and weight data. 

This complexity is further amplified by jurisdictional fragmentation. Tribal lands are managed under different authorities, such as  the US Forest Service (USFS) FACTS for federal forests, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) systems for Trust lands, and separate platforms for Fee lands, each requiring distinct data structures and reporting protocols. On top of this, tribal entities must also navigate a growing landscape of external programs with overlapping but non-uniform data requirements. Initiatives like United States Department of Agriculture Hazardous Fuels Transportation Assistance Act (USDA HFTA), Environmental Protect Agency Climate Pollution Reduction Grants (EPA CPRG), ARB LCFS, and BioRAM all demand variations of similar datasets. As a result, tribes often submit incompatible data formats to multiple agencies and registries. 

These parallel, uncoordinated workflows contribute to increasing schema fragmentation, complexity and administrative burden. Data sovereignty also emerged as a central concern, particularly regarding how sensitive information,  such as geolocation data tied to culturally significant resources, is shared. To protect these resources while still contributing to broader data systems, it was  emphasized that tribes have the ability to “blur” or “jitter” coordinates. Any integrated system must also preserve the integrity of key fields, such as high fire-hazard designations, land ownership classifications, and silvicultural practices, to meet the compliance requirements  of programs like LCFS and BIO-RAM.

###### California State Agencies 

Agencies currently rely on siloed portals, CalMapper, CPUC’s annual reports, CARB’s LCFS/Mandatory Reporting Regulation (MRR), and CalRecycle’s SB 498/SB 1383/Recycling and Disposal Reporting System (RDRS) feeds, each with its own data requirements. SB 1383 (Senate Bill 1383), in particular, established California's mandate to divert 75% of organic waste from landfills by 2025, recognizing the significant role organic waste plays in methane emissions. 

The regulation requires jurisdictions to implement extensive organic waste collection, recycling, and procurement programs, while also submitting detailed reporting via systems like RDRS to demonstrate compliance. Agency staff described the current reporting environment as a fragmented maze of stand-alone portals, each with misaligned data fields and duplicative workflows. CalRecycle highlighted the inefficiencies: “At CalRecycle, we already validate tonnes and addresses in RDRS, but CARB has its own LCFS upload, and the CPUC receives separate spreadsheets. If they had an electronic reporting system we could all audit as needed and save everyone time.” A representative of CPUC added, “Wherever it could be standardized from what we collect and share statewide, that would help us verify costs without chasing three different documents.”

Interviewees stressed that any new reporting layer must not increase program costs or burden participants with redundant data entry. It was  cautioned that additional requirements “must not add cost to the utilization process,” emphasizing that the priority should remain on acres treated, not paperwork. To that end, stakeholders advocated for leveraging existing data sources like CalMapper, RDRS, and LCFS annual reports, rather than requiring landowners to re-enter the same information across systems.

##### ***Chain of Custody Design Considerations***

Interviewees emphasized that future CoCsuccess depends on treating data standardization and system interoperability as core infrastructure, not an afterthought, warning that inconsistent definitions and siloed systems risk undermining compliance and adoption. They envision a single authoritative vocabulary that is continuously versioned and openly published, enabling every party to use consistent definitions for permits, locations, loads, and material attributes. A consistent vocabulary across agencies and users would eliminate duplicative spreadsheets by aligning data fields in stewardship plans, compliance reports, and regulatory audits, reducing manual reconciliation and enabling seamless data reuse across systems. 

In practical terms, the architecture must accommodate both modern software and long-standing manual tools, translating existing systems into a unified model without forcing everyone to adopt the same interface on day one. Operators must navigate a maze of state, federal, and commercial databases, each using its own field labels and data formats. Therefore, interviewees called for seamless data exchange across systems, enabling information from existing log-accounting tools, permit files, or spreadsheets to flow directly into regulatory reporting without manual re-entry. Accordingly, the standard should function less like a monolithic application and more like a multilingual interpreter, capable of accepting varied dialects yet delivering responses in one consistent, canonical format. 

Specific privacy, sovereignty, and confidentiality safeguards are managed under the “Privacy, Trust & Collaborative Governance” theme, ensuring this architectural layer remains focused on vocabulary alignment, interoperability, and backward-compatible version control.

#### End-To-End Traceability & Audit-Ready Lineage

End-to-end traceability & audit-ready lineage ensures that every batch or load of biomass is accompanied by a verifiable digital trail tracking its journey from initial harvest through transportation, certification, processing, and ultimately to final utilization, such as biochar production or power generation. This audit-ready ledger, designed to be tamper-evident, facilitates immediate retrieval of detailed lineage data necessary for regulatory compliance and verification by standards bodies such as FSC, SBP, LCFS, and utility and carbon-credit registries.

##### ***Cross-stakeholder Key Findings and CoC Implications***

All stakeholder groups consistently identified fragmented, manual workflows and siloed data systems as primary barriers to efficient biomass tracking and compliance. **Across certification experts, supply-chain operators, reporting teams, Tribes, NGOs, and state agencies, participants described reliance on paper tickets, ad-hoc spreadsheets, and multiple portals, each with its own data definitions, which leads to duplicated effort, transcription errors, and excessive administrative burdens*.*** In every context, interviewees emphasized that margins on biomass are razor-thin and that overly burdensome tracking costs will drive operators to abandon biomass rather than incur extra paperwork. Moreover, all groups highlighted the necessity of end-to-end traceability: every batch must carry verifiable lineage data, from GPS-verified harvest polygons or permit IDs through haul, weigh, and processing events, to satisfy auditors’ demand to see “exactly where this ton came from.” Because commingled loads (*e.g.*, logging slash blended with kiln residue) preclude strict segregation, multiple stakeholders agreed that adopting scalable mass-balance accounting is the most feasible and effective approach to reconcile physical volumes with data records, reducing complexity in the data standard while ensuring certification integrity without excessive field-level segregation.

##### ***Stakeholder-Specific Insights***

###### Biomass Certification & Operations Experts 

Because auditors expect to see exactly “where this ton came from,” including permit scans, scale tickets, and certificate declarations in a single export, **the system must facilitate immediate retrieval of detailed lineage data for regulatory compliance and verification by standards bodies such as FSC, SBP, LCFS, and carbon-credit registries**. 

Participants noted that commingled batches, such as logging slash and kiln residue, make real-time data layer-physical material flow reconciliation difficult. Mass-balance accounting, not strict segregation, requires lineage records to include volume and attribute metadata (*e.g.*, “20 tons of FSC credit from THP 123”). Mass-balance accounting was widely viewed as the only scalable input-output reconciliation method. As one participant explained, systems are based on traceability through  mass balance \- volumes in, volumes coming out \- ensuring volumes aren’t oversold. 

Another interviewee shared that  it is not possible to trace an individual piece of lumber back to its exact origin. Instead, their organization  uses a mass-balanced approach to track certification. They explained that when FSC or SFI certified material is purchased, it is linked to a specific sale or Timber Harvest Plan (THP) from the state. This sale or area brings the certification to a specific mill, which then carries and passes those certification credits through the lumber. This approach relies on  mass balance, where logs go into an inventory and come out through a lumber inventory, and the chips representing those credits follow through the process proportionally. 

Stakeholders also observed  that “data systems don’t work as fast as commercial workflows”, making it challenging to reconcile material and data layers simultaneously across multiple active ledgers. This challenge was described  as “a game of seven-dimensional chess” that requires sophisticated, integrated, and automated software systems capable of real-time reconciliation, mass balancing, and data standardization.

###### Biomass Supply-Chain Experts 

Paper trip tickets are heavily used in manual processes, but the process of data transcription and manual handling often results in incomplete or inconsistent capture of key metadata such as source permit, pile ID, and high-hazard zone flag metadata. While this information may exist elsewhere (*e.g.*, within THPs or BioRAM reporting), it may not always be directly or consistently linked to individual loads at the time of transaction. 

Interviewees  described carbon-critical data being transported on hand tags with three identical paper copies (one for the supplier, one for the driver, and one for the mill) , where a clerk re-keys them into spreadsheets.  This paper-based system was described as functioning largely on “implicit trust” between supplier and buyer, which could be abused if someone “played games with trip tickets.” To ensure BioRAM compliance, some interviewees reported using harvest-document numbers and GIS maps to prove loads originate in high-hazard zones. However, it was acknowledged that any system could be taken advantage of. Some organizations  hire GIS analysts to cross-check THP polygons and HHZ overlays before filing monthly compliance packages. 

**End-to-end traceability remains limited because data enters accounting systems only after material departs the forest.** Crews record load details on paper hand tickets, with weigh masters entering weights and source data into Three-Log or spreadsheets. This delay prevents real-time physical-reported tonnage reconciliation. Experts say that after-the-fact weigh-master entries hinder volume verification, forcing operators to aggregate data for periodic reports instead of continuously monitoring flows. Mixtures of biomass from different landowners at central chipping locations or urban wood collection complicate matters. Tracking individual pieces through the supply chain was described as 'pretty hard' and difficult to imagine for milling and mixing large volumes of chips, stakeholders said. Because of this, some certification bodies track volumes at the sale or load level, using a bulk or mass-balance approach, rather than tracking each piece.

###### Biomass Reporting Stakeholders

Interviewees emphasized that linking source location, silviculture type, and compliance percentages is critical but currently labor‑intensive. One stakeholder noted that logs delivered in January may be milled nine months later, making it nearly impossible to trace sawdust back to its original THP. BioRAM contracts further require precise sourcing ratios (*e.g.*, 60% from high-hazard zones and 80% sustainable forest management), forcing manual collection of volume, THP, and location data across numerous sites. Auditors for BioRAM contracts, particularly those engaged by PG\&E, also push back when mill residues lack upstream permit data (*e.g.*, THP numbers), as they increasingly require detailed source documentation to verify compliance. 

In one example, an interviewee recounted a geolocation error that mistakenly placed a project in Roseville instead of Santa Rosa which “took a 10‑minute phone call to correct,” t, underscoring the need for accurate coordinates. **Stakeholders recommended simplifying compliance through percentage- or mass-balance systems**, **describing this approach as “much easier” than physical segregation**. Participants  supported shifting reporting toward high-level source identifiers and aggregate volumes instead of tracking individual units and emphasized the importance of aligning California’s LCFS rules with federal RFS to avoid conflicting requirements.

###### NGO and Tribal Community Stakeholders 

Stakeholders interviewed anticipate that future carbon-credit verification will require cradle‑to‑credit traceability, including for biomass sourced from external suppliers beyond their control. There are   plans to tag loads using harvest permits or project-area polygons (*e.g.*, Tribal Forest Protection Act (TFPA) lands, areas managed under hazardous fuels reduction grants, or those within high fire threat zones). As one interviewee explained, “for our biochar project, there’s going to have to be a lot of tracking, from the forest to pyrolysis, to the biochar, to the carbon credits.” Others advocated for “radical transparency,” emphasizing  that stakeholders be able to verify the source location, management plan, and specific silvicultural practices down to the polygon level. While this level of granularity can build trust, it must also protect Tribal sovereignty. 

###### California State Agencies 

Stakeholders describe a patchwork of overlapping but non‑aligned datasets, each tied to different regulatory or operational mandates, resulting in a wide range of agency-specific requirements. CARB requires delivery records and waste-definition validation to meet LCFS and MRR compliance; CPUC audits BioRAM cost-recovery claims; CAL FIRE tracks acres treated using CalMapper; DOC tallies those acres for the state’s carbon inventory; and CARB’s Natural and Working Lands division requires geospatial linkages for remote sensing analysis. CalRecycle, through its RDRS system, monitors material flows, feedstock origins, and diversion efficiency under SB 498 and SB 1383\. 

These requirements, though interconnected, often demand distinct and highly specific data inputs. **Without a unified system, stakeholders are left duplicating work across portals, repeatedly re-entering geolocation, feedstock classification, permit data, moisture content, treatment type, and final disposition, leading to inconsistent records, compliance risk, and audit fatigue**.

##### ***Chain of Custody Design Considerations***

**End-to-end traceability demands a unified data architecture that harmonises every provenance field, permit identifier, geolocation, volume, moisture, silvicultural practice, and owner type, into a canonical, version-controlled schema exposed through open APIs.** The standard should ingest records from existing log-accounting systems, legacy spreadsheets, and state or federal portals without manual re-entry, ensuring that disparate datasets converge in a single interoperable model. 

Within this architecture, the system must instantiate a digital “batch object” for every truckload or material lot. As each batch moves through harvest, haul, receipt, processing, and final dispatch, the data standard should define how immutable timestamped events are appended, how parent metadata is carried forward when loads split or merge, and how real-time mass balances are calculated. Automated variance checks must surface overselling or unexplained weight losses so operators can resolve discrepancies before audits. A tamper-evident, append-only event ledger, whether blockchain-enabled or encrypted, underpins verifiability, while cryptographic hashing or write-once logs assure auditors that no records have been altered. One-click export profiles must transform the same ledger entries into regulator-specific packets, from FSC CoC  reports to LCFS pathway submissions, eliminating parallel spreadsheets and reducing compliance risk. 

Protection of sensitive location and ownership details should leverage the privacy and governance mechanisms described in the previous theme, avoiding duplication of controls while ensuring continuous custody. By integrating seamless data ingestion, immutable event capture, and streamlined audit outputs, the data standard will deliver comprehensive, trustworthy traceability without imposing additional administrative burden.

#### Low‑friction, mobile‑first data capture

Low‑friction, mobile‑first data capture refers to a field‑ready application that replaces legacy paper tickets and cumbersome desktop portals with a lightweight, offline‑capable interface optimized for smartphones and tablets. Users can scan barcodes or QR codes on load tags, auto‑capture GPS coordinates, snap photos of permits or scale tickets, and select from simple pick‑lists. In‑app validation catches errors immediately, drastically reducing back‑office corrections and easing onboarding for truckers, loggers, Tribal crews, and other field operators. While some data capture tools exist today, they often operate in isolation; integrating a standardized CoC framework and shared data standards would allow these systems to interoperate, improve data consistency across programs, and ensure that information captured in the field flows seamlessly into regulatory, market, and reporting systems.

##### ***Cross-Stakeholder Key Findings and CoC Implications***

All stakeholder groups uniformly reported that current field data workflows remain overwhelmingly analog, relying on paper tickets, handwritten log books, and later transcription into spreadsheets, resulting in pervasive errors, redundant effort, and significant back-office burden. Interviewees emphasized that any new solution must feel simpler than the status quo, as operators already work at razor-thin margins and resist added complexity. **Consequently, they underscored that offline operation is non-negotiable: users must be able to scan barcodes or QR codes, capture GPS coordinates (or legacy township–range–section references), and photograph permits or scale tickets entirely offline, with immediate in-app validation to catch typos or missing fields.** Moreover, all groups noted that training time must be minimal, with role-tailored interfaces (*e.g.*, drivers, loaders, weigh masters, and Tribal crews requiring distinct layouts) and simple pick-lists (*e.g.*, active THP IDs, project codes) to reduce cognitive load in remote, no-signal environments.

##### ***Stakeholder-Specific Insights***

###### Biomass Certification & Operations Experts 

Offline GPS capture and timestamped permit photos were described as essential for credible origin proof, especially under evolving EU deforestation rules. Interviewees noted that for many users, even a simple template was considered too burdensome. One stakeholder explained, “for 80% of the folks we work with, even a simple template was too much to ask.” Mobile-first strategies were seen as a way to provide higher-fidelity data, including real-time location tracking. 

In the field, capturing precise GPS polygons for each truckload is challenging due to the lack of an automated system. To meet operational workflows and EUDR requirements, a CoC system should support Township–range–section (TRS) and GPS inputs.  TRS was cited as  standard for geographic location within most forest plans, but EUDR compliance requires precise latitude and longitude data. The platform must let users select TRS offline and geotag automatically when possible due to mixed-source loads complicating GPS tagging. The system provides low-friction, reliable harvest-to-delivery traceability by prompting simple mobile entry of location, timestamp, and load details and syncing online.

###### Biomass Supply-Chain Experts 

Stakeholders stressed that operators are already stretched and resistant to additional burdens: “grab a ticket, fill it out, drive on” remains the prevailing workflow. Weigh masters manually enter dozens of loads per shift, introducing typos, source ID mismatches, and missing fields. Forest and mill landings have connectivity gaps, so offline mode with automatic sync upon reconnection is necessary. Because transportation and processing costs already put many operations at or below break-even, any new system must minimize administrative overhead to secure buy-in. 

Interviewees stated that adding new administrative burdens risks reducing biomass entering the supply chain. Thus, simple training, staged rollouts, and field crew input during beta tests are needed for adoption. 

Existing workflows were described as “pretty old school…hand tags entered into the accounting system” with truck-driver mix-ups cited as a common weak point  contributing to data quality issues. It was also reported that mills often  re-type FSC status or contract details after scale-house intake (the initial check-in point where a facility weighs incoming loads of biomass, records delivery details from drivers, and enters supplier and transport information into tracking systems), adding to back-office burden. Participants emphasized that any tool must “demonstrate improvement on the margin side” or be resisted.

###### Biomass Reporting Stakeholders 

Operators indicated that a mobile tool will only be adopted if it streamlines existing workflows and functions offline. Electronic devices were described as useful for verifying whether material comes from a particular location, though concerns were raised that such tools could add work rather than save time. Truck‑mounted GPS  was viewed as potentially burdensome and likely to face resistance from drivers. 

**Stakeholders emphasized that connectivity gaps at landings and scale shacks make offline capability, local data storage, and in-app error checks essential. They expressed strong interest in using barcode or QR scanning to minimize manual entry.** Barcode systems are already in use at some scale houses for load-specific tracking, though moisture, mileage, and silviculture data are still logged manually. To be adopted, any new tool must work alongside existing ticketing practices, support GPS auto-capture, and be intuitive enough to require minimal training.

###### NGO and Tribal Community Stakeholders

Despite widespread smartphone use, load data still flows through paper tickets, GIS files, and Excel. Ian Current workflows were described as relying on scale tickets,GIS,and spreadsheets, an approach still considered largely analog by stakeholders. In remote areas without cell service, tools must operate offline, cache data locally, and sync when connectivity returns. Sampling approaches, such as scaling a proportion of truckloads (*e.g.*, one in every twenty in some cases), underscore  the need to minimize in-field steps while still producing audit-ready records. 

While crews currently rely on handwritten tickets, GIS and Excel to track biomass movement, stakeholders  emphasized the importance of reducing data-entry burdens. It was  noted that “data collection is weakest at the landing; anything that reduces retyping is welcomed.” Interviewees also indicated  that random-sample verification can provide a workable alternative to full tracking in some contexts. To support reconciliation without imposing new burdens, the system should also include back-office dashboards and avoid requiring third-party vendors to install dedicated apps.

###### California State Agencies 

Field officers already track forestry loads with ticket books. John McCarthy of CAL FIRE observed, “Give them an easier way to do it and they will embrace it,” but stakeholders stress that any tool must not complicate existing workflows or add cost. CARB warned that the stakeholder community would not accept a situation where they are required to collect significantly more data unless it pertains to truly impactful elements. The Department of Conservation reiterated, “The CoC process must not add cost to the utilization process.” CPUC noted that excessive requirements, such as GPS on every truck, could distort market dynamics and deter participation.” Agency stakeholders see value in selective automation, especially geolocation, yet emphasize that systems must function fully offline and align with current ticket‑book practices.

##### ***Chain of Custody Design Considerations***

Interviewees agree that a low-friction, mobile-first approach must begin with an offline-capable application that stores entries securely on the device and synchronises automatically when a signal returns. Such resilience is critical because crews often work in canyons, tribal territories, and mill yards where connectivity is intermittent. To shorten data-entry time and improve accuracy,possible design approaches could include minimising typing through the use of barcode or QR scans, single-tap GPS and photo capture, and pre-loaded pick-lists with valid permits, contract numbers, and species codes. Embedded validation rules (*e.g.*, volume cannot be zero, coordinates must fall inside the authorized harvest block) should flag errors at the point of capture rather than after back-office review, thereby reducing costly rework. 

Stakeholders also emphasised the importance of workflow personalisation. Drivers, loaders, weigh-masters, and tribal monitors need role-specific screens and micro-training videos that allow them to learn new tasks in minutes, not hours. The design must accommodate grant-mandated sampling by automatically selecting the correct loads, logging the required documentation, and storing receipts in digital form. 

Flexible permission controls are essential to protect data sovereignty while still enabling third-party loggers or independent third-party scaling bureaus (organizations that verify log volumes and convert load data into digital reports to ensure supply chain transparency) to contribute authorized records. 

Finally, the mobile tool must act as a bridge rather than a silo. Direct API integration with facility scales, laboratory information systems, and legacy log-accounting tools will eliminate duplicate entry and convert data capture from a regulatory burden into an operational efficiency. Extensive field testing, under real-world dust, glare, and glove-on conditions, should confirm that the application truly lowers cognitive load and withstands remote environments. 

By combining resilient offline operation, ultra-rapid data capture, contextual validation, and frictionless integration, the data standard can enable  traceability to be embedded into day-to-day workflows without introducing new pain points, thereby securing broad adoption across the biomass value chain.

#### Automated Compliance & Market-Ready Reporting

Automated compliance & market-ready reporting embeds built-in workflows and report templates within the CoC system to convert raw biomass data into fully formatted, regulation- and market-compliant deliverables, covering BioRAM, BioMAT, LCFS, RFS, RPS, GHG inventories, EPA grants, carbon registries, and more. With one click or an API call, users can generate the exact data each agency or registry expects, complete with data validations, scheduling, and deadline reminders.

##### ***Cross-Stakeholder Key Findings and CoC Implications***

All stakeholder groups unanimously reported that current compliance and reporting processes are overwhelmingly manual, fragmented, and resource-intensive, forcing teams to piece together data from disparate spreadsheets, portals, and certification systems. Interviewees described how manual spreadsheet macros and one-off templates leave them “drowning in deadlines” and at risk of penalties. Consequently, they emphasized the critical need for a platform that embeds a centrally maintained library of continually updated report templates (*e.g.*, XML, JSON, CSV, and PDF) for every major regulatory program (BioRAM, BioMAT, LCFS, RFS/RINs, RPS, GHG inventories, EPA grants, carbon registries, and export standards). Stakeholders also requested that a declarative rules engine must enable nontechnical staff to adjust validation logic and emission factors without coding, and that automated job schedulers should generate draft submissions well ahead of deadlines, route them for sign-off, and submit them via secure API endpoints (*e.g.*, CARB Gateway, EPA CDX) to eliminate redundant data entry and reduce administrative overhead.

##### ***Stakeholder-Specific Insights***

###### Biomass Certification & Operations Experts 

Certification and operations experts described the challenge of managing compliance across a range of state and federal programs, such as CARB, EPA, CEC, and USDA , as well as voluntary registries, each requiring different templates and deadlines, a complexity that is further compounded by the need for manual validation against each program’s distinct business rules. Month-end or quarter-end deadlines can force certification teams to scramble.

###### Biomass Supply-Chain Experts 

Interviewees described extensive manual effort in compliance reporting: they spend hours exporting Excel from one system, massaging formulas, and then uploading to another portal, risking deadline misses and errors. 

Participants noted that some facilities rely on external consultants to  assemble and file BioRAM reports, incurring costs that can reach several thousand dollars per month, a level  interviewees consider unsustainable  at scale. Missing monthly sustainable-sourcing targets or filing deadlines can trigger price reductions or fines, adding real risk to manual workflows. 

Participants strongly desire a system capable of aggregating state, county, federal, and certification data (including FSC audits and HHZ flags) into one location to improve efficiency. They also emphasized the need for future-proofing so that a single dataset can satisfy new frameworks without rework or duplicate entry. 

It was noted that power plants can face revenue reductions of up to30% if BioRAM loads fall below the 80% high-hazard-zone threshold. Participants also described how  facilities must feed separate Excel sheets to CARB and CalRecycle, each requiring THP numbers and geolocation for every truckload, resulting in idiosyncratic, disparate pieces of documentation that must be manually aligned before upload.

###### Biomass Reporting Stakeholders 

Current routines demand heavy manual effort and leave little margin for error. Quarterly reporting to PG\&E on sources and volumes was described as an onerous task with some staff spending a significant portion of their time on compliance activities. BioRAM reporting templates were described as increasingly complex,  with deadlines that leave little room for delays. Manual calculations, High Hazard Zone versus non‑HHZ splits, Sustainable Forest Management percentages, require combing through Timber Harvest Plans. 

Segregating mill residues was described as particularly  challenging. Stakeholders want a platform that automates data pulls, applies compliance logic (HHZ, SFM, diameter limits) in real time, and generates regulator‑ready reports without adding new fields or exposing proprietary details. Any automation must slot into existing workflows and keep sensitive data confidential.

###### NGO and Tribal Community Stakeholders 

Tribes face a growing web of reporting obligations and expect a CoC platform to automate compliance. Some are already meeting USDA’s Hazardous Fuels Transportation Assistance requirements by weighing one in twenty truckloads and retaining signed receipts. Upcoming EPA-supported biochar projects are expected to  add GHG accounting and life‑cycle analysis. Tribal staff anticipate that future  UPUC and ARB LCFS audits may require geo‑referenced harvest data, stand‑type distinctions, and confirmation that material originates in high‑fire‑hazard zones, reinforcing the need for automated systems that can handle location-based data, simplify compliance workflows, and generate compliance ready reports with minimal manual processing. 

Beyond compliance, Tribes want to highlight land‑stewardship values and co‑benefits often overlooked by standard timber forms. There is strong interest in tagging each load as “tribal biomass” and, where appropriate, flagging “indigenous‑based” prescriptions that enhance wildlife habitat and community resilience. 

###### California State Agencies 

Agencies describe current reporting as labor‑intensive and fragmented. CPUC staff “spend substantial time reconciling quarterly and annual BioRAM filings” because utilities submit incompatible spreadsheets. CARB auditors face similar hurdles when confirming diameter, which, while not regulated by ARB, was discussed as a potential attribute that could aid verification in future systems.  CAL FIRE noted that “load-level tracing proves difficult because logs from multiple silvicultural prescriptions often share a truck,” requiring manual allocation rules. 

CalRecycle reiterated that “a single statewide portal where facilities upload delivery receipts, geolocation tags, and supporting documents would give CARB a consistent way to audit records,” while the Department of Conservation and the Governor’s Office cautioned that the new systems must streamline workflows without adding cost or deterring participation.

##### **Chain of Custody Design Considerations**

To enable automated compliance and market-ready reporting, the CoC design must unify disparate inputs, such as THP/NEPA lookups, high-hazard-zone (HHZ) designations, and permit GIS overlays, into a single master dataset. This eliminates duplicate effort by ensuring all programs draw from one authoritative record. The system should include dashboards that flag missing declarations, expiring certificates, and validation errors before deadlines. A version‑controlled rule library must codify evolving requirements and alert users when fields become mandatory. Multi‑program bundle functionality should generate a single set of data that satisfies agencies like CARB, CalRecycle, CPUC, EPA, and USDA simultaneously, streamlining audits and adapting to regulatory changes. 

On top of this, a modular report‑generator library with preconfigured templates (*e.g.*, BioRAM, RFS, LCFS, BioMAT, CalRecycle, CPUC, EUDR/EPA) must embed sampling and GHG‑factor logic, automatically calculating summaries and LCFS thresholds for feedstock eligibility, feedstock classification (*e.g.*, forest biomass waste vs source-specific feedstock), transportation distance, treatment purpose, and biomass diameter limits, so that reference data feeds directly into each formula. A declarative rules engine should validate records against program‑specific logic (feedstock tiers, HHZ splits, emission factors) and let non‑technical admins adjust criteria, such as minimum HHZ percentages, without coding. 

Automated schedulers must produce draft reports well before deadlines, trigger reminders, and package submissions for direct API uploads (CARB Gateway, EPA CDX, EU Union Database). To meet unique needs, scenario-driven exports should assemble the required data fields for registries with one click, while custom field groups, like Indigenous Prescription Codes or high-fire‑hazard flags, flow through the same workflows. 

By embedding these template‑driven functions, the CoC system converts manual “fire drills” into error‑resistant, audit‑ready processes that reduce compliance costs and scale as requirements evolve.

#### Privacy, Trust & Collaborative Governance

Privacy, trust & collaborative governance establishes a permissioning and consent framework within the CoC system that ensures each participant controls who can view specific data details and when. Sensitive fields, such as exact tonnages, GPS coordinates, and pricing, can be masked or embargoed and later aggregated in public dashboards after a configurable delay. All data accesses are logged, while stakeholders collaboratively manage schema changes and data-sharing policies through an embedded governance portal, ensuring the system evolves transparently and in alignment with participant needs.

### *Cross-Stakeholder Key Findings* 

All stakeholder groups consistently identified that privacy and trust are foundational requirements for any CoC system, as participants must retain control over sensitive commercial, geographic, and financial data. Interviewees across certification bodies, supply-chain operators, reporting teams, tribes, NGOs, and state agencies all stressed that exact tonnages, GPS coordinates, and pricing must be protected through field-level masking or embargoes, with data only exposed after a configurable delay or to specific roles. At the same time, they acknowledged that regulators and voluntary market programs demand sufficient transparency, such as geospatial proof of origin or high-hazard-zone sourcing, to verify compliance. Consequently, every group underscored the need for a robust, role-based access control framework that defines per-field permissions (for example, logger, auditor, public viewer), coupled with immutable audit logs of all data reads and writes.

### *Stakeholder-Specific Insights*

###### Biomass Certification & Operations Experts 

Competitive concerns prevent data sharing because companies fear competitors will exploit it. Data  may not be shared due to the dynamic nature of supply chains, where downstream recipients can become  competitors. Intermediaries often avoid disclosing wood sourcing locations, viewing them as a competitive advantage, which complicates GPS-based traceability. 

To address these concerns, stakeholders emphasized the need for granular sharing controls. Strategies such as  obfuscating sensitive origin details, masking precise locations, and validating source legitimacy were seen as important to building trust. 

Working groups are developing interoperability standards for CoC data, enabling secure collaboration without competitive disadvantage through access controls, permission levels, and standardized data-sharing agreements. Integration with state forest agencies, such as CAL FIRE, was viewed as a potential way to track origination while protecting proprietary acreage data. Provenance can be validated without exposing sensitive locations by linking THP details into internal frameworks, building trust through accurate data and limited metadata access. Internal systems that track purchases, vendor details, certifications, and permits and can meet state reporting and taxation requirements while maintaining confidentiality. 

Direct integration with CAL FIRE was also described as a way to streamline verification and reduce errors by eliminating manual THP retrieval. Existing data structures and permissioned sharing were seen as critical to ensuring  collaborative governance \- allowing stakeholders to trust data integrity while companies retain control.

###### Biomass Supply-Chain Experts

Stakeholders pointed out that competitive sensitivities run high among farmers, ranchers, and private landowners, who fear that divulging haul distances or pricing information could enable competitors or media to undercut their operations. 

It was emphasized that certain data must remain protected to prevent competitive harm.  Concerns were raised about sawmills’ hesitancy to share volume and pricing data, emphasizing that protecting commercially sensitive information is important to system adoption. Interviewees explained that facilities have agreements treating THP numbers and geolocation data as competitive information that should not be made public, especially as competition for high-hazard fuel has already driven up prices. Others expressed  that if detailed data is shared with the state and later misinterpreted or taken out of context, it could lead to the forest products industry being blamed or penalized for outcomes beyond their control.  Once made public, such data can be misunderstood, leaving the industry vulnerable to inaccurate conclusions and unintended consequences. 

Given that some organizations are subject to the Public Records Act, stakeholders emphasized the need for a system that  supports selective redaction and enables separate “public” and “detailed” views to safeguard sensitive content. It was also noted  that data transparency is particularly sensitive among farmers and ranchers, and that confidence in robust privacy protections is essential for system adoption. 

Multiple interviewees linked system adoption to establishing trust and maintaining control over data, stressing that users will not commit information to a platform unless they retain consent rights over how and when their data are shared.

###### Biomass Reporting Stakeholders 

Data confidentiality is paramount: revealing sources could jeopardize competitive positions. Concerns were raised about  sharing information due to its confidential nature and the risk of losing competitive advantage.  In some cases facilities label documents for internal use  and only release full records during audits. Other interviewees noted that sharing detailed percentages could make operations more vulnerable to external scrutiny.  

Simultaneously, regulators and voluntary programs require transparency to ensure accountability. It was noted that THPs often contain GHG calculations that might be leveraged directly for verification purposes.  While tracking down to log‑to‑log at the landing was seen as necessary, stakeholders emphasized the importance of ensuring each load can be tied back to the correct prescription.” This tension demands governance structures that balance confidentiality with the need for verifiable, audit‑ready data.

###### NGO and Tribal Community Stakeholders 

Tribal leaders insist on data sovereignty as non‑negotiable. For certain species and locations, such as mushrooms or yew trees, there must be a way to obscure specifics and  hide geolocation data to protect cultural and ecological sensitivity. Simultaneously, other interviewees emphasized the importance of  “radical transparency” via a public interface to allow NGOs to independently  spot‑check compliance. 

Utilities and biomass aggregators worry that exposing haul distances, pricing, or volumes to the public could distort markets, while regulators (EPA, CARB, CPUC) require enough visibility to verify compliance. Balancing these priorities requires fine‑grained permissioning, ensuring tribes control sensitive data while providing transparent, GIS‑driven oversight where needed, and collaborative policy development to establish shared governance rules.

###### California State Agencies 

Agencies consistently balance confidentiality with transparency. Public Utilities Commissions (CPUC) staff warned that “pricing… because of competition for the supply, could skew things” if disclosed, and CARB noted the “tension between regulatory transparency needs and market participant privacy. It was also stressed that any increased transparency must not impose burdensome costs or create barriers to participants or reduce biomass utilization. 

The Department of Conservation (DOC) must track “acres treated and carbon sequestered, linking biomass fate to greenhouse‑gas consequences, while CARB uses geolocation to infer transportation distance, grid mix, and emission drivers. CalRecycle emphasized that a unified portal offers “an easy, easy way and consistent way” for CARB to access chain‑of‑custody records during audits. 

Agencies favor a privacy‑by‑design approach: encrypt sensitive fields, restrict access to authorized regulators, aggregate data for public dashboards, and protect competitively relevant information only as long as necessary.

## Chain of Custody Design Considerations {#chain-of-custody-design-considerations}

Effective privacy, trust, and collaborative governance are essential for stakeholder adoption. Companies, Tribes, agencies, and NGOs will share detailed provenance data only if they control how and when others access it. To enable this, the design should centre on a federated governance layer where authorized representatives propose, debate, and ratify schema or policy changes via transparent, versioned workflows. Treat “permission” as metadata by implementing fine‑grained, field‑level role‑based access controls so data owners can disclose volumes, prices, or coordinates selectively, enforce timed embargoes, or publish only aggregated values. Configurable geospatial obfuscation, jittered points, pixelated polygons, or centroid‑only exports, can shield sensitive locations while supporting analytics. 

To ensure accountability, generate immutable, tamper‑evident audit logs for every read, write, or schema update, linking user identity, timestamp, and action, and send automated notifications for any permission or schema changes. By combining participatory governance, field‑level privacy controls, and comprehensive auditability, the data standard establishes mechanisms that satisfy  regulators’ spot‑check requirements while respecting competitive sensitivities and tribal data sovereignty, thereby fostering durable trust and voluntary data sharing.

#### Desired Information for CoC System to Track

The desired information for the CoC system to track defines the comprehensive dataset required to support robust CoC management, regulatory compliance, and market pathways. By identifying all critical data elements, ranging from geolocation and material characteristics to transactional and operational details, the data standard  defines how to capture, validate, and analyze every facet of biomass sourcing, handling, and reporting. A clearly articulated information inventory shapes the system’s data model, user interfaces, and integration capabilities.

#### **Cross-Stakeholder Key Findings and CoC Implications**

All stakeholder groups consistently identified that a robust CoC system must capture a comprehensive set of data elements, most critically, precise origin identifiers (THP or NEPA IDs and geolocation, whether via GPS coordinates, legal land descriptions, or polygons), accurate volume measurements (bone-dry tons, board feet, or mass-balance allocations for commingled streams), and clear classification of biomass type (primary feedstocks versus processing residues, origin (forest vs. orchard), and certification status). 

Participants emphasized the necessity of recording supplier, hauler, and transaction details, including transport dates, weights, and mileage, as well as key sustainability attributes such as high-hazard-zone flags, silvicultural prescriptions (even-aged vs. uneven-aged management or Indigenous-based practices), and environmental metrics (moisture content, emissions factors). All groups noted that current manual workflows, paper tickets, Excel spreadsheets, and siloed permit portals, are error-prone, labor-intensive, and impede real-time traceability, mass-balance reconciliation, and timely regulatory or market reporting. 

At the same time, stakeholders uniformly voiced concerns about protecting sensitive commercial and cultural data, such as exact tonnages, pricing, and the precise locations of culturally significant species, while ensuring sufficient transparency to satisfy auditors, regulators, and voluntary market verifiers.

### Competing Design Requirements and Trade-Offs

#### **Transparency vs. Data Privacy and Confidentiality**

The competing demands for transparency and data privacy create a central tension in designing a robust biomass CoC system. NGOs and certain regulators require comprehensive visibility into supply chain activities to verify compliance and assess claims such as additionality and CoC integrity. In contrast, Tribes, commercial operators, and some state agencies emphasize safeguarding sensitive information, ranging from cultural resource locations to proprietary business data, to prevent misuse or competitive disadvantage. 

Balancing these priorities requires a design that fosters accountability while preserving confidentiality. NGOs and specific regulators champion “radical transparency.” They argue that public access to detailed harvest polygons, management plans, and silvicultural data allows stakeholders to perform spot checks and confirm adherence to sustainability standards. Regulators further require geospatial proof of origin to ensure biomass sources meet legal and environmental criteria. They maintain that without such visibility, it becomes difficult to validate supply chain integrity. 

Conversely, Tribes and commercial stakeholders prioritize data sovereignty and competitive confidentiality over open disclosure. Tribes insist on the ability to obscure or blur precise geolocation details to protect culturally significant resources. Commercial actors, mill operators, haulers, and certification experts, express concern about revealing exact tonnages, pricing, haul distances, and source locations, fearing that exposure could compromise their market position. As a result, they require robust access controls, field-level data masking, embargoes, and granular permissions. 

State agencies mediate between these polarized viewpoints. They recognize regulators’ need for transparency to enforce compliance and privacy advocates’ need to limit exposure of sensitive data. To address both, agencies favor privacy-by-design: encrypting critical fields, aggregating data for public dashboards, and implementing role-based access controls. By blending transparent verification mechanisms with customizable privacy safeguards, a successful CoC system can balance accountability with cultural and commercial confidentiality.

| Agency parallel: CEQA tribal cultural resource confidentiality. Under AB 52, CEQA documents omit exact locations of tribal archaeological sites and sacred lands, placing detailed maps and descriptions in confidential appendices accessible only to tribes and authorized officials. This tiered disclosure model lets the public see that resources exist and will be protected, while an access‐controlled layer retains precise data for regulators and project proponents.[^4]  |
| :---- |

## 

#### **Granularity of Traceability vs. Operational Feasibility and Data Burden**

Designing a robust CoC system faces tension between the demand for load-level traceability and the realities of operational feasibility. Auditors, certain regulators, and market programs such as LCFS require verifiable lineage data for each batch, expecting links back to specific permits or harvest polygons. Tribes also intend to tag individual loads for detailed spot checks to ensure provenance. These stakeholders argue that granular origin data provides essential transparency and auditability. 

However, supply-chain operators, mills, reporting stakeholders, and state agencies confront the impracticality of tracking commingled loads. Once logging slash, kiln residue, and other feedstocks merge, tracing individual chips or pieces to their exact source becomes difficult. Certification experts acknowledge that only mass-balance accounting or percentage-based allocation methods can meet auditing needs without overburdening operations. 

Reporting stakeholders highlight the difficulty of tracing processed materials, such as sawdust, back to the original THP many months after harvesting. State agencies agree that tracking mixed materials, whether different species split at the landing or multiple waste streams received at a facility, inevitably requires allocation methods, as seen in CalRecycle’s reporting system, which includes recovery efficiency data. Interviewees emphasized that adding data requirements is only worthwhile when they deliver clear verification benefits, and that additional reporting will only gain acceptance if it captures the most meaningful and impactful information.To reconcile the need for detailed mass/energy balance evidence for LCFS compliance with technical feasibility and market participation, a CoC system must support aggregated data handling and respect participant privacy. Focusing data collection on high-impact control points and permitting commingling where justified could help the system support automated auditing, structured data reviews, and more efficient audits that might reduce the need for third-party oversight. 

Such an approach may also streamline compliance across facilities, leverage existing infrastructure to avoid redundant processes, and keep incremental costs low, potentially easing overall reporting expenses for energy providers.

| Agency parallel: CPUC “15/15 Rule” for energy-use data. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) releases community-level electricity and gas-consumption statistics only after aggregating them to ≥15 customers and ensuring no single account exceeds 15% of the total. Utilities and regulators retain the full meter-level records, but the public sees only anonymized, census-tract-scale data delivered through portals such as the UCLA Energy Atlas. By building role-based access, automatic aggregation, and geolocation masking into the data pipeline itself, CPUC satisfies advocates of open-data climate policy while shielding competitively or personally sensitive information.[^5]  |
| :---- |

#### **Data Requirements for Compliance vs. Stakeholder Sensitivity to Cost and Effort**

Regulatory bodies and market programs demand rigorous data collection and reporting for biomass CoC systems, yet all stakeholder groups insist that the system remain cost-effective and minimally burdensome. Regulators and market programs stipulate detailed data elements (*e.g.*, origin, volume, feedstock type, high-hazard zone designations, silvicultural practices, transaction records, and environmental metrics) for compliance, auditing, and verification. They enforce reporting deadlines, and missing targets or data requirements can trigger penalties. Consequently, these entities seek comprehensive, accurate information to ensure transparency and uphold sustainability standards. 

In contrast, operators and state agencies emphasize that existing manual tracking processes already impose heavy administrative burdens and erode profit margins. They highlight the need to reduce per-ton tracking costs, streamline workflows, and eliminate duplicate data entry. Stakeholders warn that overly complex or costly tracking could lead operators to abandon biomass utilization altogether. 

State agencies echo these concerns, cautioning that any added cost or complexity risks deterring participation and undermining the system’s credibility. They assert that the CoC platform must integrate seamlessly with current operations without inflating overhead or requiring extensive training. 

Balancing these priorities will require a carefully designed CoC system that satisfies regulatory data demands while remaining practical for end users. System architects must collaborate with regulators, market programs, operators, and state agencies to identify essential data fields, automate data capture where possible, and minimize manual inputs. By prioritizing both compliance and operational efficiency, the CoC system can foster broad participation, reduce risk of noncompliance, and support sustainable biomass markets without imposing undue financial strain.

| Agency parallel: CARB’s use of third‑party verifiers & mass‑balance credit systems (LCFS, GHG reporting). Rather than upload every truck’s route and weight to a central database, CARB requires biorefineries and fuel suppliers to submit aggregate volumes and rely on accredited verifiers to audit supporting records (*e.g.*, contracts, invoices, shipment logs). In LCFS, participants earn credits via mass‑balance accounting, tracking total input/output balances, rather than logging each load. Verifiers receive confidential details directly; the agency only ingests aggregated summaries.[^6]  |
| :---- |

#### **Geolocation Data Precision Requirements vs. Privacy and Operational Preferences**

Regulators, market programs, and certification bodies increasingly demand precise geolocation data, such as GPS coordinates or GIS polygons, to verify biomass origin, calculate transport distances, assess fire hazard zones, and comply with evolving standards like the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR). These entities emphasize high-resolution mapping to ensure that each load meets legal and environmental criteria. For example, California Air Resources Board’s (CARB) LCFS program requires location specifics to confirm that feedstocks originate from approved zones and adhere to sustainability benchmarks. 

Conversely, Tribes, commercial stakeholders, and operators prioritize data privacy, sovereignty, and operational simplicity over granular coordinates. Tribes insist on the right to obscure exact locations to safeguard culturally sensitive sites and maintain control over their land data. Commercial actors share similar concerns, fearing that revealing precise GPS data could expose competitively valuable information about procurement zones and operations. 

Operators also highlight that capturing load-level GPS data proves “very demanding” in practice; they often rely on Township-Range-Section (TRS) identifiers common in forest planning. In regions with limited connectivity, reliance on TRS instead of real-time GPS proves more reliable. Moreover, some drivers resist truck-mounted GPS tools, which they view as intrusive or cumbersome during routine workflows. 

A versatile CoC design is essential to balance these differing priorities by offering information at multiple levels of spatial resolution. Aggregated or masked geolocation techniques, such as jittered coordinates, township-range-section references, or buffered polygons, could be explored as options to meet regulatory verification objectives while still protecting privacy and accommodating existing field workflows. This approach preserves auditability without imposing undue burdens on Tribes or operational actors.

| Agency parallel: CDFW’s California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB). Public users see rare‐species occurrences only at the scale of a 7.5′ USGS quadrangle (\~10 km²), while authorized biologists and agencies obtain exact coordinates under strict data‑use agreements. This “geolocation masking” prevents poaching or vandalism by obscuring precise locations, yet still informs regional planning and environmental oversight.[^7] |

### A Stakeholder-Informed Data Standard

Our recommendations for the standard design captures the essential elements identified by stakeholders (*e.g.*, location and permit IDs, management and certification attributes, load/volume and transport metrics, regulatory linkage fields, and privacy/transparency controls, etc.), enabling interoperable software that reduces reporting overhead, enhances transparency, and streamlines compliance across diverse frameworks.

## 

## Development of the BOOST Data Standard {#development-of-the-boost-data-standard}

The development of the Biomass Open Origin Standard for Tracking (BOOST) represents a stakeholder-informed response to the complex and fragmented landscape of biomass CoC systems identified through comprehensive stakeholder research and regulatory analysis. This section synthesizes findings from international certification system analysis, California and federal regulatory review, and extensive stakeholder interviews to provide a comprehensive rationale for developing a unified biomass data standard that addresses real-world operational challenges while enabling regulatory compliance and market transparency.

#### **The Current State of Biomass Chain of Custody Systems**

Our research reveals a biomass supply chain ecosystem characterized by significant fragmentation across three critical dimensions:

1. **Certification framework diversity**: Analysis of international standards (ISCC, SBP, FSC, SFI, PEFC, RSB, ISO 38200\) demonstrates substantial variation in CoC approaches, data requirements, and digital infrastructure capabilities. While each system serves specific market needs, this diversity creates interoperability challenges that increase transaction costs and limit market efficiency.  
2. **Regulatory complexity**: The regulatory landscape spanning California (LCFS, BioMAT, BioRAM), federal (RFS), and international (EU RED III, EUDR) programs presents overlapping but inconsistent data requirements. Market participants face the burden of maintaining multiple compliance frameworks with misaligned data definitions and reporting protocols.  
3. **Operational inefficiencies**: Stakeholder interviews revealed that current practices rely heavily on manual processes, paper-based systems, and disparate software platforms. Market participants consistently reported spending 50-66% of administrative time on compliance reporting, with significant risks of transcription errors and data inconsistencies.

#### **Stakeholder Pain Points Driving BOOST development** 

Interview findings across biomass certification experts, supply chain operators, reporting stakeholders, NGOs, tribal communities, and regulatory agencies identified five critical challenges:

1. **Administrative burden**: Thin margins in biomass markets make additional administrative costs prohibitive, requiring any new system to demonstrate clear value through reduced transaction costs or increased revenue opportunities.  
2. **Data integration challenges**: Existing systems (*e.g.*, Three-Log LIMS, GIS databases, THP records, tribal documentation) operate in isolation, requiring manual data compilation, and increasing error risk.  
3. **Regulatory fragmentation**: Current requirements force market participants to re-enter identical data across multiple portals (*e.g.*, CARB LCFS, CalRecycle RDRS, Energy Commission, CPUC BioRAM) with different formatting requirements.  
4. **Privacy and sovereignty concerns**: Commercial confidentiality requirements and tribal data sovereignty considerations demand sophisticated access control mechanisms that current systems cannot provide.  
5. **Scalability limitations**: Existing approaches fail to accommodate the diverse operational scales and technical capabilities across the biomass supply chain, from large industrial operators to small tribal enterprises.

#### **Understanding data standards: definition, role, and open development**

BOOST is a data standard, meaning that specifies data formats, field definitions, validation rules, and a shared vocabulary to enable consistent interpretation of biomass CoC information. It also provides validation mechanisms to ensure data quality and consistency. BOOST does *not* prescribe or create specific software applications, databases, user interfaces, centralized data storage, nor does it entail a loss of stakeholder control over data. This distinction addresses stakeholder concerns identified in interviews about system replacement and vendor lock-in. By focusing on data structure rather than software implementation, BOOST enables innovation in tools and applications while ensuring interoperability.

##### **How data standards enable chain of custody systems**

Data standards serve as the foundational layer that make sophisticated CoC systems possible by addressing the core challenges identified through stakeholder research.

The BOOST framework establishes this foundational layer of interoperability for biomass chain of custody tracking. Just as HTTP enables different web browsers and servers to communicate, BOOST enables different chain of custody software systems to exchange information seamlessly. A core takeaway of Carbon Direct’s research was the presence of fragmented data formats and systems; BOOST is designed to remedy this. By adhering to a unified standard, supply chain participants can avoid the cumbersome task of reconciling disparate data formats. 

Data standards also enable a shared set of validation rules and practices for quality assurances. When a transaction modes from one organization’s system to another, standardized validation ensures the receiving system can interpret and process the data correctly. This reduces the costly cycle of error correction that stakeholders identified as a major pain point. Furthermore, by defining standard formats for documenting custody transfers, processing operations, and certification claims, BOOST enables the creation of comprehensive and trustworthy audit trails. 

BOOST is designed from the outset with scalability and flexible implementation in mind. Organizations can continue to use their preferred software solution while reducing transaction and administrative costs. The standard reflects the varying degrees of technical sophistication amongst stakeholders in that it is flexible and avoids being overly prescriptive where not absolutely necessary. It also avoids assumptions about levels of sophistication of the software that will be using the standard: it is designed to be applicable to everything from spreadsheets to custom built SaaS solutions.

##### **The Case for Open Standards Development**

BOOST is an open development data standard, meaning it was created through transparent collaborative processes. Specifications, documentation, and decision making are all publicly accessible and community driven. This community-driven approach ensures that no single entity can unilaterally change the standard or restrict its use. As a guiding framework, BOOST adopts the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Community and Business Group Process, which provides mechanisms for multi-stakeholder collaboration.

An open data standard development process entails that all decisions are transparent and occur in public forums, such as Github repositories or public mailing lists. Each design choice has associated documentation. W3C open development principles also dictate that BOOST standards are developed under licensing frameworks that ensure implementations can be created without royalty payments or restrictive licensing terms. BOOST deliverables use the W3C Software and Document License, enabling anyone to implement, modify, and distribute BOOST-compliant software without licensing fees or restrictions. All BOOST contributors agree to the W3C Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA), which ensures that contributions can be freely used while protecting the community from patent claims and licensing restrictions.

This licensing approach directly addresses stakeholder concerns about vendor lock-in and long-term accessibility identified in interviews, ensuring that investments in BOOST implementation are protected regardless of changes in any single organization's business strategy.

**Successful open standard examples**:

**The Global Standards 1 (GS1)**: The GS1 organization develops open standards for supply chain visibility used across industries. GS1's success demonstrates how open development creates widespread adoption;their standards are used by over 2 million companies globally because no single vendor controls the specification. This model enables innovation in implementation while ensuring compatibility.

**The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standards**: The ISO develops consensus-based standards through transparent, multi-stakeholder processes. ISO 38200 for wood CoC demonstrates how open development in forest products creates broad industry acceptance and regulatory recognition.

**The World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Standards**: The W3C’s open development of HTML, XML, and related technologies enabled the internet's explosive growth. No single company controls these standards, allowing innovation and competition in browsers, servers, and web services while maintaining interoperability.

**JSON and REST APIs**: These open data exchange standards power modern web services precisely because they are not controlled by any single vendor. Organizations can build on these standards with confidence that they will remain available and evolve through community consensus.

The open development approach directly supports BOOST's core mission of reducing transaction costs and enabling market efficiency. By ensuring no single entity controls the standard, open development creates the conditions for widespread adoption and continuous innovation that stakeholders identified as essential for success.

### Technical Requirements and Design Principles 

#### **Core data architecture requirements**

Carbon Direct’s analysis of biomass regulatory and certification programs identified a number of common elements that must be captured in CoC systems. The architecture and data standard requirements must be flexible enough to apply to all relevant supply chain entities, yet strict enough to enable consistent translation and interpretation. Each set of elements contains fields that should be sufficient to describe universal properties of supply chain participants and transactions, while also allowing for extension to cover fields or attributes that are specific to individual entities, biomass categories, or reporting standards.  

Entities and organizations must include fields describing their role, legal status, affiliations with certification schemes, jurisdiction, and contact information. Transaction objects, which describe the actual attributes of the biomass, must include consistent representation of quantity, category, type, geographic origin, temporal tracking of custody transfers and upstream processing activities. These can be thought of as the dynamic component of the supply chain that moves from source to end user. Certification and sustainability attributes describe the biomass source, sustainability claims, risk assessment documentation, and any greenhouse gasses associated with the biomass. 

#### **Core Data Standard Components**

BOOST’s core data standard utilizes a JSON schema to define fields and associated validation rules. Data types are standardized and validated to ensure interoperability. The model defines entity relationships that link components together, which enables comprehensive mapping of the entire supply chain and its history. Data exchange requirements are defined by a RESTful API specification, which enables ease of interaction with legacy and new software systems alike. More detailed delineation of these components can be found in the appendix. 

#### **Data Standard Structure and Format**

##### **Core entity design rationale**

The BOOST data standard organizes information around fundamental entities that directly address the operational challenges and regulatory requirements identified in previous sections. Each entity captures essential information needed to track biomass through complex supply chains while supporting diverse certification schemes and regulatory frameworks.

**Organizations**: Stakeholder interviews revealed the critical importance of clearly identifying all entities in the biomass supply chain, from forest managers to end users. Organizations represent legal entities that take custody of biomass, with specific roles (*e.g.*, producer, processor, trader, consumer) that determine their regulatory obligations and certification requirements. This addresses the fragmented responsibility chains identified in Section 2, where unclear entity relationships create compliance risks and audit difficulties.

**Biomass consignments**: Analysis of certification systems in Section 1 demonstrated that all schemes track biomass in discrete quantities or batches as they move through the supply chain. Consignments represent these trackable units of biomass, capturing quantity, type, origin, and temporal information essential for mass balance accounting and regulatory reporting. This entity directly responds to stakeholder needs for automated transaction documentation and audit-ready records.

**Sustainability information**: The regulatory analysis revealed varying but overlapping sustainability criteria across programs (*e.g.*, LCFS geographic requirements, RFS renewable qualification, EU due diligence obligations). This entity captures sustainability characteristics linked to biomass sources, enabling flexible reporting across multiple frameworks without duplicating data collection efforts.

**Certification claims**: Interview findings emphasized the complexity of managing multiple certification schemes simultaneously. This entity documents specific claims (*e.g.*, FSC-certified, SBP-compliant, etc.) and their verification status, addressing stakeholder concerns about maintaining certification integrity while enabling cross-scheme compatibility.

**Transactions**: Supply chain stakeholders identified transaction tracking as fundamental to CoC integrity. This entity documents the transfer of custody between organizations, capturing essential audit trail information while supporting both physical segregation and mass balance accounting models identified in certification system analysis.

##### **Entity Relationships and Information Flow**

The relationships between entities reflect real-world biomass supply chain operations while accommodating the diverse business models identified through stakeholder research.

**Hierarchical relationships**: Organizations can be linked in parent-subsidiary structures, addressing the complex corporate arrangements common in biomass markets. Consignments can be split or combined, reflecting physical processing operations while maintaining traceability.

**Temporal relationships**: The standard captures time-based connections between transactions, enabling the historical analysis required for regulatory audits and certification renewals. This addresses stakeholder concerns about audit preparation time and compliance verification.

**Certification linkages**: Claims can be associated with organizations, consignments, or transactions depending on certification scheme requirements. This flexibility accommodates the varying approaches identified in international certification analysis while maintaining data integrity.

**Geographic connections**: Sustainability information includes geographic elements that can be linked to consignments at varying levels of precision, from county-level for LCFS reporting to plot-specific polygons for EU regulations. This graduated approach addresses privacy concerns raised by tribal communities while meeting regulatory requirements.

##### **Linked Data Approach and Rationale**

The BOOST standard employs linked data principles to address the interoperability challenges identified throughout stakeholder research and regulatory analysis. This approach enables data sharing across organizational boundaries while maintaining system independence and reducing integration costs.

**Vocabulary reuse**: Rather than creating entirely new data definitions, BOOST incorporates established vocabularies from relevant domains (geographic standards, business registries, certification schemes). This reduces learning curves for implementers and leverages existing data quality mechanisms, directly addressing stakeholder concerns about implementation complexity.

**Unique identification**: Each entity receives globally unique identifiers that enable unambiguous reference across different systems and organizations. This solves the entity matching problems identified in stakeholder interviews, where the same organization or biomass batch might be referenced differently across various platforms.

**Flexible associations**: Linked data enables organizations to publish only the information they choose to share while maintaining connections to related data. This addresses the privacy and commercial confidentiality concerns raised consistently across stakeholder groups, particularly tribal communities and commercial operators.

**Progressive disclosure**: The linked data model supports graduated information sharing, where basic transaction information can be public while detailed commercial or culturally sensitive information remains protected. This directly responds to the tension between transparency requirements and privacy needs identified in stakeholder interviews.

**System integration**: By providing standardized ways to reference external systems and databases, the linked data approach enables integration with existing platforms (Three-Log, GIS systems, regulatory portals) without requiring wholesale replacement. This addresses the critical stakeholder requirement that new systems must complement rather than replace existing investments.

**Future extensibility**: The linked data foundation enables the standard to evolve and incorporate new requirements without breaking existing implementations. This addresses the dynamic regulatory environment identified in Section 1, where requirements continue to evolve across California, federal, and international frameworks.

The linked data approach directly supports the core BOOST principle of interoperability by design, enabling the seamless data exchange that stakeholders identified as essential for reducing transaction costs and improving market efficiency. By building on web standards and established practices, this approach minimizes technical barriers while maximizing compatibility with existing and future systems.

### Future Development

Details on future development opportunities will be developed in the final draft following discussions with California state agency stakeholders to ensure alignment with regulatory priorities and implementation feasibility.

### Conclusion

The development of BOOST is a necessary and timely response to documented challenges in biomass CoC systems. By synthesizing regulatory requirements, certification system analysis, and stakeholder needs, BOOST provides a comprehensive framework addressing real-world operational challenges while enabling sustainable biomass market development.

The rationale for BOOST development rests on solid empirical foundations: demonstrated stakeholder pain points, clear regulatory alignment requirements, and quantifiable economic benefits. The standard's design principles ensure practical implementation while maintaining flexibility for future evolution.

Success in BOOST development and adoption will contribute to broader policy objectives including climate change mitigation, sustainable forest management, rural economic development, and environmental justice. By reducing transaction costs and enhancing transparency, BOOST supports the growth of sustainable biomass markets that benefit all stakeholders while advancing societal environmental goals.

The comprehensive approach outlined in this rationale demonstrates that BOOST development is not merely a technical exercise but a strategic intervention addressing systemic challenges in biomass supply chains. Through careful attention to stakeholder needs, regulatory requirements, and market dynamics, BOOST provides the foundation for a more efficient, transparent, and sustainable biomass economy.

# **Recommendations** {#recommendations}

The project employed a multi-method approach to develop its recommendations. It began with a meta-analysis of existing biomass tracking systems, CoC models, existing regulatory programs and reporting requirements.The most important systems, frameworks and policies are shown below in Table XX.

##### **\[TABLE XX\] Prioritized CoC systems, international frameworks, state policies, US federal policies, and international policies.** 

| Policy | Type |
| :---- | :---- |
| The Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP) | Existing CoC system |
| Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) | Existing CoC system |
| Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) | Existing CoC system |
| Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) | Existing CoC system |
| Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) | Existing CoC system |
| California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) | State policy |
| The Bioenergy Market Adjusting Tariff (BioMAT) | State policy |
| Bioenergy Renewable Auction Mechanism (BioRAM) | State policy |
| California Forest Practice Rules | State policy |
| California Senate Bill 498 reporting | State policy |
| The Federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) | US federal policy  |

To ensure the recommendations reflected real-world needs, the project team carried out structured stakeholder interviews with representatives from California state agencies, industry, tribal communities, and non-governmental organizations. These interviews helped uncover operational challenges and supply chain constraints critical to the system’s design. 

Drawing on these findings, the team developed recommendations for a scalable and adaptable biomass tracking system tailored to California’s context. Recommendations include:

**Implement an integrated, standards-based data architecture**: There is a strong need for a standardized format for biomass data, to facilitate automatic data exchange. A uniform data structure is critical for enabling seamless, error-free communication across stakeholders, especially within a complex regulatory framework. 

**Ensure end-to-end traceability and audit-ready lineage**: The system should replace manual processes with an automated digital ledger to enable real-time, verifiable tracking of biomass inputs and outputs. This would ensure precise lineage data, support audit trails, enable instant reconciliation, and simplify regulatory reporting by capturing biomass origin details. 

**Develop low-friction, mobile-first data capture tools**: A mobile-first data capture solution should be simple and intuitive for field operators, supporting minimal friction during use. Priority capabilities include offline access, real-time validation via drop-downs and checks, and the ability to attach photos and GPS data directly to records. 

**Enable automated compliance and market-ready reporting**: The system should automate the generation of reports for regulatory and voluntary programs like RFS, LCFS, BioRAM, and BioMAT. Streamlining reporting workflows would reduce manual reporting burden, ensure compliance, and improve operational efficiency across various regulatory frameworks.

**Focus development on the value proposition for adoption**: The system’s effectiveness hinges on broad adoption, which requires the system to either lower transaction costs or enhance the value of transactions. Without delivering clear economic benefits to users, widespread use and, consequently, its public utility may be limited.

**Implement robust data privacy**: Robust data privacy safeguards are essential to encourage participation. In their absence, voluntary adoption is likely to remain low. Market participants are hesitant to share sensitive market information, while regulatory agencies are cautious about disclosing data that could compromise public interest goals or disrupt market efficiency.

To begin the process of CoC system development, we created the Biomass Open Origin Standard for Tracking (BOOST). BOOST is a data standard: it specifies data formats, field definitions, validation rules, and a shared vocabulary to enable consistent interpretation of biomass CoC information. It also provides validation mechanisms to ensure data quality and consistency. 

Finally we recommend a phased implementation strategy for the BOOST data standard, balancing immediate needs with long-term vision:

**Phase 1 (Version 0.1)**: Core standard specification with California regulatory focus, emphasizing LCFS and biomass procurement program alignment. Version 0.1 will be published alongside the final version of this report.

**Phase 2**: Federal regulatory integration, particularly RFS program compatibility and EPA reporting requirement accommodation.

**Phase 3**: International standard alignment, focusing on EU regulatory framework compatibility and certification scheme interoperability.

**Phase 4**: Advanced feature development including AI integration, blockchain compatibility, and emerging technology accommodation.

### Summary of non-prioritized programs and certifications 

### International Frameworks

#### **The International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC)**

The International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) is a global certification system that ensures sustainable, deforestation-free, and climate-friendly supply chains. It certifies raw materials and products based on environmental, social, and traceability criteria. ISCC operates in over 100 countries across Europe, the Americas, Asia, and Africa, and is recognized under major regulatory frameworks including the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED II and RED III), the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), Japan's Feed-in-Tariffs, and the voluntary ISCC PLUS program. 

ISCC’s sustainability criteria require that biomass be produced in an environmentally responsible manner. This includes protecting natural resources such as soil, water, and air, as well as ensuring safe labor conditions and adherence to human rights. Acceptable feedstocks under ISCC include dedicated energy crops, agricultural residues, woody biomass, biogenic residues and waste, and other recycled materials. 

To ensure compliance, ISCC mandates biomass tracking and traceability protocols. All supply chain participants must maintain documentation of biomass origin, quantity, and transactions. This includes contracts, delivery records, and sustainability declarations. The ISCC uses a mass balance approach (certified and non-certified materials can be mixed), but accounting must show that the certified output does not exceed the certified input within the tracking period. Chain of Custody (CoC) certification is required for all entities handling sustainable biomass, ensuring end-to-end compliance from production to final use.

ISCC also provides design requirements for traceability and verification. While physical segregation is optional, particularly for specialized markets like food-grade biomass, all certified materials must be traceable through the supply chain. ISCC employs digital tools for this, requiring electronic records for sustainability declarations, delivery and purchase records, and third-party audits to confirm compliance. These systems reinforce the integrity of CoC implementation and ensure that ISCC-certified biomass meets the expectations of both regulators and sustainability-minded stakeholders.

#### **International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 38200**

ISO 38200 is an international standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization to establish a framework for Chain of Custody (CoC) tracking of wood, wood-based products, cork, and other lignified materials such as bamboo. Unlike forest management certifications, ISO 38200 does not address how forests are managed but instead focuses entirely on the systems used to trace material through the supply chain—from origin to final product. The standard is designed to be globally applicable across organizations of all sizes and supply chain roles, offering a common structure for organizations to collect, maintain, and communicate information about the legal and physical characteristics of wood-based materials they buy, process, or sell.

The core function of ISO 38200 is to enable traceability of input materials, ensuring they are legally harvested, procured, and transferred through verified systems. It defines different categories of input materials including legally harvested, certified, verified, recycled, and specified material. These categories determine the kind of documentation required and the level of due diligence an organization must perform. All organizations using the standard must establish a Due Diligence System (DDS) that includes collecting general information about material origin, risk assessment, risk mitigation measures, and verification protocols. Notably, ISO 38200 provides guidance on identifying high- and low-risk sourcing contexts and outlines specific steps for mitigation, making it suitable for risk-based traceability approaches.

ISO 38200 supports multiple CoC control methods to accommodate the operational realities of diverse supply chains. These include physical separation, percentage-based methods (both single percentage and rolling average models), and a credit system. Physical separation requires that certified and non-certified materials be kept apart at all times, providing the highest integrity but also the highest burden. Percentage methods allow for calculated mixing of certified and non-certified materials across defined product groups or timeframes. The credit method allows input credits from certified material to be allocated to outputs, offering maximum flexibility but requiring precise conversion factors and robust documentation. Organizations choose and implement the appropriate model based on their material flows, product types, and customer expectations.

To align with ISO 38200, a CoC system must support tracking and documentation requirements. This includes keeping records of all transactions, material categories, and conversion factors, as well as output declarations and labeling. The system must maintain documentation that is auditable and secure, with evidence retained for inspection by certification bodies. Organizational roles and responsibilities must be clearly defined, and management must commit resources to maintain compliance. The standard emphasizes management accountability, staff training, and internal audits to ensure CoC system performance. While it does not mandate specific technologies like blockchain or centralized registries, the flexibility of ISO 38200 makes it adaptable to digital implementations and integration with other certification schemes, such as FSC or PEFC, when used in a complementary manner​.

### California Policies

#### **The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)**

CEQA is a foundational environmental statute that mandates state, regional, and local agencies to assess and disclose the environmental impacts of proposed projects. CEQA requires agencies to adopt feasible mitigation measures when those impacts are deemed “significant.” It provides the public and regulators a standardized framework for environmental review and transparency. The California Energy Commission (CEC) plays a key role in administering CEQA processes for energy facilities under the authority of the 1974 Warren-Alquist State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Act.

For biomass facilities larger than 50MW, CEQA compliance is managed through the CEC’s Application for Certification (AFC), which functions as a streamlined alternative to the traditional Environmental Impact Report (EIR). This centralized process helps bypass the need for facilities to seek multiple approvals across agencies. Smaller facilities under 100MW may qualify for a “small power plant exemption,” with the CEC still serving as the lead agency and preparing the necessary CEQA documentation, typically a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) or full EIR.

For new biomass facilities under 50MW, CEQA jurisdiction falls to local agencies—typically county or city planning departments. In these cases, air quality management and pollution control districts (AQMD and APCD) often take on the lead agency role. CEQA offers several statutory exemptions relevant to biomass or industrial cogeneration, including:

* §15329: For cogeneration additions at existing facilities with no net increase in emissions.  
* §15330: For hazardous substance cleanup projects in full compliance with existing environmental laws.  
* §15332: For infill developments on sites smaller than 5 acres within city limits.

Feedstock sourcing under CEQA is addressed separately based on land type. On private and state lands, biomass procurement is governed by the Z’Berg-Nejedly Forest Practice Act (1973), which requires a Timber Harvest Plan (THP) as the functional equivalent of a CEQA review. On federal lands, activities are instead regulated by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which necessitates environmental analysis prior to vegetation treatments. These parallel statutes ensure that harvesting practices meet environmental review standards, even if not explicitly covered under CEQA.

Importantly, CEQA does not include CoC requirements for biomass. While it sets parameters for environmental disclosure and project permitting, CEQA’s scope does not mandate supply chain documentation, mass balance systems, or digital traceability tools. This absence presents a potential gap in the policy landscape—highlighting an opportunity for future CoC standards to complement CEQA by adding verifiable feedstock-level accountability.

### International Policies

#### **The European Union Renewable Energy Directive III (EU RED III)**

EU RED III is a cornerstone policy of the EU’s climate strategy, adopted in 2023 to advance the bloc’s goals of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 55% by 2030\. RED III mandates that only sustainable, legally compliant, and traceable renewable energy sources — including biomass — can be certified for the EU market. It covers a wide scope of energy types, including renewable fuels of biological and non-biological origin (*e.g.*, hydrogen, biogas, woody biomass), and it enforces strict lifecycle emissions thresholds and sustainability safeguards.

While RED III is now in effect, the systems and tools required for its full implementation are still in development. EU member states have until 2026 to demonstrate how they will implement the directive, including the structure and operation of Chain of Custody (CoC) systems. As a result, many CoC and traceability requirements remain in flux, and practical standards are still being defined. This creates both uncertainty and an opportunity to shape RED III-aligned infrastructure using existing certification models and innovations in digital tracking.

RED III has strong implications for CoC design and traceability infrastructure across global supply chains. The policy mandates the use of a centralized Union database to track renewable fuel consignments and their sustainability attributes. This system ensures traceability and data integrity, prevents fraud, and supports compliance through mass balance models and guarantees of origin. Operators must document and verify sustainability attributes at every supply chain stage, while certification bodies must conduct risk-based audits and geolocation-based reporting to meet enforcement criteria. RED III’s digital emphasis also promotes the integration of blockchain, geolocation mapping, and digital IDs.

Supply chain CoC requirements under RED III are centered around mass balance systems, which allow operators to mix certified and non-certified inputs under strict accounting. However, clear records of sustainability attributes must be maintained. Digital guarantees of origin, especially for renewable gas, are used in parallel to ensure traceability. The CoC system must link with both national certification schemes and the Union’s central digital infrastructure, supporting seamless data exchange and interoperability across EU member states. These mechanisms aim to accommodate supply chains of varying complexity, scale, and regional context. Existing CoC and sustainability certification providers are still refining their approach to CoC implementation under RED III. A shared data standard, discussed later in this document, could play an important role in ensuring alignment, interoperability, and readiness during this transitional period.

Design considerations for CoC systems under RED III include scalability, regional applicability, and data security. CoC models must be flexible enough to support both small and large operators and accommodate diverse supply chains while remaining efficient and practical. RED III promotes uniform sustainability standards across all member states, minimizing regional disparities. Operators are required to submit lifecycle GHG data, sustainability verification reports, and digital delivery records to comply with certification systems approved under RED III. This increases compliance costs but also incentivizes innovation in digital traceability infrastructure.

#### **European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR)**

EUDR was adopted in 2023 as part of the EU’s broader climate and biodiversity strategy. It aims to minimize the EU’s contribution to global deforestation and forest degradation by requiring that products placed on or exported from the EU market are deforestation-free, legally produced, and fully traceable to their origin. EUDR applies to seven commodities (cattle, cocoa, coffee, oil palm, rubber, soy, and wood) and extends to a broad list of derived products, including pulp, paper, furniture, and leather. Operators must ensure that no deforestation occurred after December 31, 2020, and that products comply with all relevant legal frameworks in their country of origin, including laws on land use, environmental protection, and labor rights.

Compliance with EUDR is being phased in. Larger companies had to comply by December 30, 2024, while small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have until June 30, 2025\. In parallel, the EU is developing a benchmarking system to classify countries as low, standard, or high-risk based on deforestation rates and governance quality. These risk ratings will inform the level of scrutiny and documentation required from operators sourcing from each region. High-risk sourcing will require enhanced due diligence, while low-risk sources may be eligible for simplified compliance.

At the core of EUDR, is a requirement for geolocation data at the plot level. For plots larger than 4 hectares, operators must submit polygon coordinates delineating the precise boundaries of land used in production. Each shipment must be tied to its origin via this geospatial data. This traceability requirement marks a departure from existing systems that often rely on mass balance or volume tracking without a link to physical geography. Operators are responsible for designing and implementing their own due diligence systems, which must collect geolocation data, assess the risk of deforestation or degradation, and establish mitigation procedures where risks are identified.

CoC systems are central to EUDR compliance, but the regulation does not prescribe a specific CoC model. Instead, it requires that operators maintain complete traceability throughout the supply chain and be able to link each product to its production plot. The regulation does not explicitly support mass balance or book-and-claim models that allow mixing of compliant and non-compliant material. While it does not prohibit these models, its emphasis on plot-level geolocation and shipment-level declarations suggests a strong preference for track-and-trace systems that maintain identity preservation. This presents a challenge for existing CoC systems that were not originally designed to track physical origin at such a granular level.

Operators cannot outsource compliance to third-party certification schemes, although such schemes may assist in risk assessment. The operator bears full legal responsibility for ensuring that all due diligence criteria are met. Certification may be used as part of the risk assessment process, but it does not remove the obligation to provide geolocation data or to perform and document due diligence. Certification can help with demonstrating legality and providing sustainability assurances, but only as a supporting element.

EUDR also outlines mechanisms for enforcement and oversight. EU Member States are responsible for conducting inspections and enforcing penalties, and they must annually report on compliance rates. The EU has also established a centralized Information System where operators must submit their due diligence statements before placing products on the market. This system will generate unique reference numbers for each shipment and allow for cross-checking of supply chain data.

The EU Observatory and other remote sensing tools, such as those provided through Copernicus, will play a key role in verification. These tools offer satellite-based monitoring, early warning systems, and geospatial mapping to support risk-based enforcement. However, use of these tools is not mandatory, and the regulation allows operators to determine how best to demonstrate compliance. The EU is also expected to develop a public dashboard for monitoring progress and benchmarking country risk, although some of these tools are still under development.

Designing CoC systems to meet EUDR requirements will require significant upgrades in digital infrastructure, data standardization, and geolocation capability. Systems must support polygon-level mapping, maintain shipment-level traceability, and interface with national and EU-level databases. Data formats will need to be consistent across actors to enable interoperability, and secure data transfer systems will be needed to manage sensitive geolocation and compliance information. Operators will also need robust internal audit mechanisms to verify that geolocation records are accurate and that mitigation procedures are followed when risks are present.

EUDR sets a high bar for supply chain transparency and is likely to reshape sourcing strategies, particularly for operators sourcing from regions with limited traceability infrastructure. While it creates challenges for small producers and exporters in high-risk regions, it also presents an opportunity to align CoC systems with emerging global expectations for sustainability and legality. Existing certification systems are actively working to adapt their CoC frameworks to meet EUDR demands, and a standardized approach to traceability and data exchange may be critical to ensuring efficient and equitable compliance across the sector.

#### **Brazil’s National Biofuels Policy (RenovaBio)**

RenovaBio was established under Law No. 13.576/2017 to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the transportation sector, enhance energy security, and promote the sustainable production and use of biofuels such as ethanol, biodiesel, and biomethane. The policy aligns with Brazil's commitments under the Paris Agreement by setting annual national decarbonization targets over a ten-year horizon. These targets are allocated to fuel distributors based on their market share of fossil fuels, mandating them to acquire Decarbonization Credits (CBIOs) equivalent to their emission reduction obligations. CBIOs are generated by biofuel producers who voluntarily certify their production processes through a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to determine the carbon intensity of their biofuels. Producers with lower carbon intensities receive higher energy-environmental efficiency scores, enabling them to issue more CBIOs per unit of biofuel sold. These credits are then traded on a regulated financial platform, providing economic incentives for both producers and distributors to engage in sustainable practices.

Central to RenovaBio is a C0C robust Chain of Custody (CoC) system that ensures the traceability of biomass from its origin to the final biofuel product. The CoC framework, detailed in ANP Resolution No. 758/2018 and Technical Report No. 06/SBQ, mandates that all entities involved in the supply chain, —ranging from biomass producers to intermediaries and biofuel producers, —implement traceability mechanisms. Two primary CoC models are recognized: physical segregation and mass balance. Physical segregation requires that traceable biomass be kept separate from non-traceable materials throughout the supply chain, ensuring direct traceability to the source. The mass balance approach allows for the mixing of traceable and non-traceable biomass, provided that the quantity of traceable output does not exceed the input, maintaining a balance of credits and debits.

To comply with RenovaBio’s CoC requirements, entities must maintain comprehensive records, including purchase and sales documents, transport invoices, and inventory logs. Each transaction involving traceable biomass must be accompanied by a "Proof of Material" document, linking the biomass to its origin through the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) code. This documentation ensures that the biomass used in biofuel production can be traced back to its source, verifying its eligibility and sustainability credentials. Additionally, entities must implement internal control systems, designate responsible personnel for CoC management, and undergo periodic audits by accredited inspection firms to validate their traceability systems.

Designing a CoC system aligned with RenovaBio necessitates the capability to handle both physical segregation and mass balance models, depending on the operational context. The system should facilitate detailed tracking of biomass through each stage of the supply chain, support the generation and management of "Proof of Material" documents, and ensure compliance with record-keeping requirements. Integration with national registries, such as the CAR, is essential for verifying the origin of biomass. Furthermore, the system must be adaptable to accommodate updates in regulatory requirements and support interoperability with other sustainability certification schemes, enhancing the credibility and market acceptance of certified biofuels.

#### **Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations**

Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations (SOR/2022-140), in force since July 1, 2023, aim to reduce the carbon intensity of liquid fossil fuels used in Canada. The regulations impose carbon intensity (CI) limits on pools of gasoline and diesel supplied by refiners and importers, targeting annual CI reductions from a 2016 baseline (95 gCO₂e/MJ for gasoline, 93 gCO₂e/MJ for diesel) through 2030 and beyond. Fuel suppliers must also meet volumetric blend requirements (5% for gasoline and 2% for diesel) by incorporating lower-CI renewable alternatives. The program uses a credit-based system to drive compliance: primary suppliers must acquire and retire compliance credits equivalent to the required reduction in CI of their fossil fuel pool. Credits can be generated through low-CI fuel production/importation, emission-reduction projects, displacing fossil fuels with alternatives (*e.g.*, renewable gas, electricity, hydrogen), or by contributing to registered emission-reduction funding programs.

CoC intersects with CFR primarily through the verification and attribution of carbon intensity values to fuels, the qualification of eligible feedstocks, and the transfer of compliance credits. To be eligible, fuels must meet detailed land-use and biodiversity criteria, including restrictions on feedstocks from areas with high biodiversity, recently deforested lands, or non-compliant forest harvesting practices. Producers and importers must also retain verifiable records regarding the origin, quantity, and sustainability status of their feedstocks. A declaration must be made by harvesters, and producers must maintain specific documentation, including site visits, audits, and clear geographic traceability (*e.g.*, GPS coordinates) to support certification claims. Accreditation of certification schemes and auditors is required, with ISO standards (including ISO 14040, ISO 14064-2, and ISO 17065\) cited LCAs, verification methods, and organizational quality.

Designing a CoC system to meet CFR requirements entails supporting batch-level traceability, auditable recordkeeping, and rigorous sustainability attribute tracking. The system must be able to distinguish among fuel classes, carbon intensity pathways, and compliance credit sources, including those originating from foreign producers or co-processing arrangements. For forest-based feedstocks and biogas-derived fuels, granular traceability to site-level origin is required, along with verification that the land-use conditions were met and no net expansion or degradation occurred. Any CoC framework must also support integration with Canada’s digital compliance credit transfer system and fulfill extensive reporting requirements, such as quarterly and annual credit-creation reports, carbon-intensity-pathway reports, and material balance reports. Because errors or unverifiable claims can result in denial of credits or certification, the data model should prioritize high fidelity, standardized formats, and compatibility with ISO-aligned LCA models.

#### **Danish Executive Order No. 1252 of 2021 (Handbook 2021\)**

**Note**: This policy is currently under revision by the Danish Energy Agency. As the updated version has not yet been made publicly available, the following summary is based on the 2021 edition of the Handbook (HB 2021).

The Danish Executive Order No. 1352 of 2021, commonly referred to as the “Handbook on fulfilling sustainability requirements and requirements for greenhouse gas emission reductions for biomass fuels for energy purposes (HB 2021),” lays out comprehensive legal requirements for the use of solid and gaseous biomass fuels in Denmark. It implements the sustainability and GHG reduction provisions of the EU Renewable Energy Directive (Directive 2018/2001/EU), but goes beyond them in certain respects through additional national criteria introduced via a 2020 political agreement. HB 2021 applies to biomass producers, importers, and energy producers exceeding specific energy input thresholds. The policy covers biomass from agriculture, forestry, non-forests, waste, and industrial residues, requiring third-party verification, documentation of geographic origin, mass balance tracking, and annual reporting to the Danish Energy Agency.

CoC requirements are foundational to HB 2021 implementation. All companies covered by the regulation must maintain systems that track the sustainability characteristics of biomass and ensure mass balance integrity. The Handbook distinguishes between “a-level” compliance (via national legislation and enforcement) and “b-level” compliance (via forest sourcing area-level management systems). CoC certification schemes like FSC, PEFC, and SBP can be used to demonstrate conformance, especially if they are approved by the Danish Energy Agency. For biomass not certified under such voluntary schemes, extensive documentation is required to prove sustainability and GHG savings. Traceability must extend to the first collection point, and third-party verification is mandated for forest biomass up to that point.

To comply with HB 2021, a CoC system must:

* Support mass balance accounting, as mixing of biomass lots is allowed only if sustainability characteristics are preserved and documented.  
* Ensure traceability to country or sourcing-area level, especially for forest biomass, with mapping of harvest sites and evidence of sustainability conditions in that area.  
* Be flexible across biomass categories, recognizing different criteria for forest, agriculture, waste, and non-forest biomass types, as shown in *Table 3.1 on page 15* of the Handbook.  
* Provide for third-party verification across the supply chain, with verifiers meeting specific qualifications (*e.g.*, certification in FSC FM, PEFC FM, SBP, and EUTR).  
* Include reporting systems that capture biomass type, quantity, origin, certification status, and GHG performance for submission to the Danish Energy Agency.  
* Incorporate mechanisms for supplier assurance, including documentation protocols, risk assessment for non-certified sources, and maintenance of data for at least five years.

Ultimately, the CoC system must demonstrate not only that biomass complies with minimum EU criteria, but also the more stringent Danish sustainability and GHG thresholds (*e.g.*, ≥75% CO₂ savings rising to 83% by 2028), and additional biodiversity, regeneration, and land-use protections for wood biomass.

#### **Context**

The development of the initial version of this data standard is funded through a grant from the California Department of Conservation. This standard is intended to broadly inform the development of biomass chain of custody tools, with an initial focus on California as the jurisdictional context. California's regulatory environment presents challenges and opportunities for participants in the biomass economy that are broadly transferable to a generalized biomass chain of custody data standard.

The group will seek participation from a balanced range of stakeholders, including civil society organizations, government agencies, small and large businesses, and independent technical experts. Recruitment and engagement efforts will be made to avoid overrepresentation of any single stakeholder group.

#### **Goals**

The mission and goals of this Community Group are to **develop and** **maintain a robust data standard for solid biomass**. to provide a structured framework to enable the systematic collection, management, and exchange of information throughout complex supply chains and processes. The goal is to ensure accurate tracking, transparency, and compliance with sustainability criteria, facilitating the reliable transfer of essential information, including sustainability characteristics and data required for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission calculations, from the source to the end-user. This standard is intended to support the needs of organizations involved in the biomass supply chain, agencies and stakeholders in the biomass economy, and systems like Chain of Custody (CoC) software, referencing concepts from documents like the Netherlands Enterprise Agency, *“Guidance Chain of* *Custody: Sustainability Criteria for Solid Biomass for Energy* *Applications.”* and related standards such as those from Sustainable Biomass Program , International Organization for Standardization, Sustainable Forestry Initiative, the Forest Stewardship Council, and the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials

#### **Scope of Work**

The scope of work includes defining a data standard that specifies the format, structure, and relationships of data elements necessary to document and transfer information about solid biomass for energy applications within a Chain of Custody system.

The standard shall cover the representation of key entities and their associated information as described in relevant guidance and standards, including:

* **Organizations (Links)** within the supply chain that take legal ownership of the biomass, including their roles and scope.  
* **Biomass Consignments** or transactions representing quantities of biomass transferred or handled, including attributes like quantity, type, and transaction dates. This includes distinguishing between Incoming and Outgoing Consignments.  
* **Sustainability Information** linked to consignments, detailing characteristics based on source and criteria.  
* **Biomass Categories** (*e.g.*, Category 1-5) based on source and type, and **Biomass Types** (*e.g.*, Sustainable, Controlled).  
* Information regarding the **Biomass Source** and Country of Origin.  
* Data related to **Mass Balance Accounts** used by organizations to track volumes and manage claims.  
* Information documenting the use of **Control Methods** like Mass Balance or Physical Separation.  
* Data points necessary for **GHG emission calculations**, including energy and carbon data, and linking this data to biomass batches. This includes data collected via specific report types such as SAR and SREG.  
* References to **Certification Schemes** (*e.g.*, FSC, PEFC, SBP) and associated **Claims** (*e.g.*, SBP-compliant, SBP-controlled), and how these claims are linked to biomass and transactions.  
* Information related to **Verification Statements** issued by independent third parties.  
* Documentation and records used for transactions and registration.  
* Data relevant to a risk-based approach, potentially including elements of a **Due Diligence System** where applicable, particularly for Category 2 biomass.  
* The standard should consider how to represent the flow of information between suppliers and recipients and the use of documentation like sales/delivery documents.  
* Consideration of alignment or interoperability requirements with existing data transfer systems, such as the SBP Data Transfer System (DTS).

The standard should be defined in a technical format suitable for software system implementation, potentially including supporting documentation.

#### **Out of Scope**

Topics known in advance to be out of scope include:

* Defining or modifying the sustainability criteria for solid biomass (these criteria are defined by regulatory or voluntary certification requirements). The standard will focus on representing data *related* to these criteria. \- Defining the specific calculation methodologies for GHG emissions. The standard will define how to represent the data *required* for these calculations.  
* Defining the processes for conducting audits, certification, or verification, or the requirements for Certification/Verification Bodies.  
* Defining the requirements for establishing or operating a complete Chain of Custody management system (these are defined in CoC standards). The standard will define the data structure that such systems would manage and exchange.  
* Governing or approving certification schemes or their specific claims.  
* Defining the legal responsibilities of organizations (these are determined by regulations and contractual agreements).

#### **Deliverables**

##### **Specifications**

The primary deliverable will be a **Biomass Data Standard** **specification**. This specification will define the structure, format, and relationships of data elements for solid biomass chain of custody information exchange. The output format (*e.g.*, JSON Schema, XML Schema, OWL/RDF) will be determined by the group. An estimated schedule for key deliverables (*e.g.*, first draft, candidate recommendation) will be developed by the group.

##### **Non-Normative Reports**

The group may produce other Community Group Reports within the scope of this charter but that are not Specifications, for instance, use cases, requirements documents based on the analysis of sources like the "Guidance" and SBP Standards, or white papers explaining the rationale and implementation considerations for the standard.

##### **Test Suites and Other Software**

The group *may* produce test suites to support the Specifications. These test suites could be used to validate data instances against the defined standard schema. The group MAY also develop reference implementations or libraries to facilitate the adoption and use of the standard. Please see the GitHub LICENSE file for test suite contribution licensing information.

#### **Dependencies or Liaisons**

The group depends on the requirements and concepts defined in the "Guidance Chain of Custody sustainability criteria for solid biomass for energy applications" and its normative references, including the Verification Protocol and Dutch regulations.

The group should consider potential liaisons or alignment efforts with organizations managing relevant existing standards and systems, including: \* **Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP)**, particularly regarding SBP Standards 4 (CoC), 5 (Data Collection), 6 (GHG Calculation), the SBP Data Transfer System (DTS), and their recognized certification schemes (FSC, PEFC). \* **International Organization for** **Standardization (ISO)**, specifically regarding ISO 38200:2018 Chain of custody of wood and wood-based products. \* Potentially, the **Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO.nl)** and the **Ministry of** **Economic Affairs and Climate Policy** in the Netherlands, who commissioned the "Guidance" document and oversee the SDE+ scheme.

#### **Community and Business Group Process**

The group operates under the Community and Business Group Process. Terms in this Charter that conflict with those of the Community and Business Group Process are void. As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing commitments under the W3C Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA). When people request to participate without representing their organization's legal interests, W3C will in general approve those requests for this group with the following understanding: W3C will seek and expect an organizational commitment under the CLA starting with the individual's first request to make a contribution to a group Deliverable. The section on Contribution Mechanics describes how W3C expects to monitor these contribution requests.

The W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct applies to participation in this group.

#### **Work Limited to Charter Scope**

The group will not publish Specifications on topics other than those listed under Specifications above. See below for how to modify the charter.

#### **Contribution Mechanics**

Substantive Contributions to Specifications can only be made by Community Group Participants who have agreed to the W3C Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Specifications created in the Community Group must use the W3C Software and Document License. All other documents produced by the group should use that License where possible.

All Contributions are made on the groups public mail list or public contrib list or through contributions in the GitHub repo the group is using for the particular document. This may be in the form of a pull request (preferred), by raising an issue, or by adding a comment to an existing issue. All Github repositories attached to the Community Group must contain a copy of the CONTRIBUTING and LICENSE files.

#### **Transparency**

The group will conduct all of its technical work in public. If the group uses GitHub, all technical work will occur in its GitHub repositories (and not in mailing list discussions). When necessary to facilitate collaboration with members unfamiliar with the use of GitHub, translation of materials in the GitHub repository into google docs can be done. Google docs used for shared editing will be archived and will be accessible to all members. If Google docs are used, all changes in the edited document will be integrated back into GitHub This is to ensure contributions can be tracked through a software tool. Meetings may be restricted to Community Group participants, but a public summary of minutes must be posted to the group's public mailing list, or to a GitHub issue if the group uses GitHub.

#### **Decision Process**

This group will seek to make decisions where there is consensus. No single organization, or coalition of organizations with shared commercial interests, shall exercise disproportionate influence over decisions.

##### **Initial Proposal Phase**

* Any member can submit a proposal for a new standard or modification  
* Proposals must include technical specifications, rationale, and implementation considerations  
* A discussion period of 1-2 weeks follows each proposal

##### **Consensus-Seeking Phase**

* Working group facilitator leads structured discussions to identify and resolve concerns  
* All objections must be documented with technical justification  
* Facilitator may request alternative proposals to address objections  
* Consensus is reached when all participants express support or "can live with it"

##### **Measuring Consensus**

* Facilitator periodically assesses consensus through explicit calls  
* Members indicate: Support, Acceptable, Concerns (but won't block), or Object  
* Consensus is achieved when no members object and at least 75% actively support or find acceptable

##### **Fallback Voting Mechanism**

If consensus cannot be reached after reasonable effort (typically 6-8 weeks of discussion):

* Facilitator calls for a formal vote with 2-week notice  
* At least 2/3 majority (66.7%) of voting members required for approval  
* All votes must include justification  
* Abstentions are noted but not counted in the percentage calculation

##### **Documentation Requirements**

All decisions must document:

* Whether achieved by consensus or vote  
* Summary of key discussion points and objections  
* Vote counts (if applicable)  
* Minority positions (especially for vote-based decisions)

After discussion and due consideration of different opinions, a decision should be publicly recorded (where GitHub is used as the resolution of an Issue).

Any decisions reached at any meeting are tentative and should be recorded in a GitHub Issue for groups that use GitHub and otherwise on the group's public mail list. Any group participant may object to a decision reached at an online or in-person meeting within 7 days of publication of the decision provided that they include clear technical reasons for their objection. The Chairs will facilitate discussion to try to resolve the objection according to this decision process. It is the Chairs' responsibility to ensure that the decision process is fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably favour or discriminate against any group participant or their employer.

#### **Chair Selection**

Through the release of version 0.1 of the data standard, Carbon Direct represented by Peter Tittmann will serve as Chair. Subsequent to the release of version 0.1 of the standard, participants in this group choose their Chair(s) and can replace their Chair(s) at any time using whatever means they prefer. However, if 5 participants, no two from the same organisation, call for an election, the group must use the following process to replace any current Chair(s) with a new Chair, consulting the Community Development Lead on election operations (*e.g.*, voting infrastructure and using RFC 2777). 1\. Participants announce their candidacies. Participants have 14 days to announce their candidacies, but this period ends as soon as all participants have announced their intentions. If there is only one candidate, that person becomes the Chair. If there are two or more candidates, there is a vote. Otherwise, nothing changes. 2\. Participants vote. Participants have 21 days to vote for a single candidate, but this period ends as soon as all participants have voted. The individual who receives the most votes, no two from the same organisation, is elected chair. In case of a tie, RFC2777 is used to break the tie. An elected Chair may appoint co-Chairs.

Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community Development Lead, after evaluating the election, may take any action including no action.

#### **Amendments to this Charter**

The group can decide to work on a proposed amended charter, editing the text using the Decision Process described above. The decision on whether to adopt the amended charter is made by conducting a 30-day vote on the proposed new charter. The new charter, if approved, takes effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself, or 7 days after the result of the election is announced, whichever is later. A new charter must receive 2/3 of the votes cast in the approval vote to pass. The group may make simple corrections to the charter such as deliverable dates by the simpler group decision process rather than this charter amendment process. The group will use the amendment process for any substantive changes to the goals, scope, deliverables, decision process or rules for amending the charter.
