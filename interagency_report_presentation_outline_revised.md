## **Slide 3: Problem Statement & Project Objectives**
**The Challenge: Fragmented Biomass Tracking in California**

**Current System Issues:**
- Fragmented, labor-intensive, paper-based tracking methods
- Limited transparency and real-time auditable data
- Significant administrative burdens on producers, processors, and agencies
- Compliance challenges across multiple programs (LCFS, BioRAM, BioMAT, SB 498)

**Project Objective:** Develop recommendations for a comprehensive Chain of Custody system to track forest biomass from source to product, enhancing transparency while reducing compliance costs

## **Slide 3: Research Methodology**
**Multi-Method Research Approach**

- **Literature Review**: Meta-analysis of existing biomass tracking systems and international CoC models
- **Regulatory Assessment**: Analysis of current California programs and reporting requirements  
- **Stakeholder Interviews**: 40+ structured interviews across 5 stakeholder groups:
  - Biomass Certification & Operations Experts
  - Supply-Chain Experts  
  - Reporting Stakeholders
  - NGO & Tribal Community Stakeholders
  - California State Agencies
- **Interagency Collaboration**: Working group coordination across state agencies

## **Slide 4: Key Research Findings - Current Pain Points**
**Cross-Stakeholder Consensus on Major Challenges**

**Operational Challenges:**
- Manual data re-entry across multiple systems and spreadsheets
- Difficulty tracing processed materials to original THPs months after harvest
- Truck driver mix-ups and scale-house data quality issues
- "Pretty old school...hand tags entered into the accounting system"

**Compliance Burden:**
- Separate reporting for LCFS, RFS, BioRAM contracts
- Manual quarterly spreadsheet compilation from various sources
- Sensitive permit/pricing data in siloed systems

*"Current practices...still get re-entered manually...an extra 'unnecessary' duplication"* - Industry Stakeholder

## **Slide 5: Research Findings - System Requirements**
**What Stakeholders Need: Unified Standards-Based Approach**

**High-Priority Requirements:**
- Unified data standard replacing fragmented processes
- Mobile-first, offline-capable field applications  
- Mass-balance accounting vs. physical segregation
- Geographic data with privacy protection
- Integration with existing systems (LIMS, ERP)

**Critical Design Principles:**
- Leverage existing data sources (THPs, permits, contracts)
- Support percentage-based compliance tracking
- Accommodate diverse feedstock types and operational models
- Reduce administrative overhead through automation

## **Slide 6: International Framework Analysis**
**Lessons from Existing Certification Systems**

**Systems Reviewed**: SBP, FSC, SFI, PEFC, RSB, ISCC
- **Strengths**: Established traceability models, stakeholder acceptance
- **Limitations**: Complex requirements, high costs, limited California-specific alignment
- **Gap**: None optimized for wildfire mitigation or California's regulatory landscape

**Key Insight**: California needs stronger alignment with state programs (BioRAM, LCFS) than existing international frameworks provide

## **Slide 7: Recommended System Architecture**
**Standards-Based Digital CoC System**

**Core Design Elements:**
- **Modular Architecture**: Serves diverse supply chain participants (mills, haulers, tribal entities)
- **Mobile-First Tools**: Offline-capable applications with GPS, photo capture, barcode scanning
- **Automated Integration**: Links to existing tracking systems and regulatory reporting
- **Mass-Balance Approach**: Practical alternative to physical segregation

**Technology Foundation:**
- Unified data standard with shared vocabulary and validation rules
- Interoperable data formats supporting multiple regulatory programs
- Real-time audit trail capabilities

## **Slide 8: System Benefits & Impact Analysis**
**Quantified Value Proposition from Research**

**Operational Efficiency:**
- 50%+ reduction in duplicate data entry burden
- Automated compliance reporting generation
- Real-time audit trail capability replacing manual documentation

**Regulatory Benefits:**
- Enhanced LCFS pathway verification and BioRAM compliance tracking
- Streamlined multi-program reporting (LCFS, RFS, BioRAM)
- Reduced third-party verification costs

**Market & Environmental Impact:**
- Increased biomass utilization from wildfire-prone high-hazard zones
- Support for renewable energy targets and carbon reduction mandates
- Enhanced stakeholder trust through transparent supply chain documentation

## **Slide 9: Implementation Challenges & Solutions**
**Addressing Stakeholder Concerns**

**Key Implementation Challenges Identified:**
- **Granularity vs. Feasibility**: Load-level traceability demands vs. operational realities of commingled materials
- **Privacy vs. Transparency**: Protecting sensitive pricing/location data while enabling verification
- **Technology Adoption**: Field crew training and connectivity in remote areas

**Proposed Solutions:**
- Percentage-based allocation methods for mixed materials
- Tiered data access with privacy controls
- Offline-capable mobile applications with role-specific interfaces
- Staged rollout with pilot programs and stakeholder training

## **Slide 10: Next Steps & Implementation Roadmap**
**From Research to Action**

**Research Phase Complete:**
- ✅ Comprehensive stakeholder needs assessment
- ✅ International framework analysis and gap identification
