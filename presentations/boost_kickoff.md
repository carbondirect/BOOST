## What is BOOST?

- BOOST stands for the Biomass Open Origin Standard for Tracking
- It is a Community Group proposed and run by the community under the W3C framework
- The development of the initial version of the data standard is funded through a grant from the California Department of Conservation

---

## What is BOOST's Mission?

- To develop and maintain a robust data standard for solid biomass
- To create interoperable data formats and protocols for tracking biomass materials from source to end-use
- To improve transparency, verification, and trust in biomass supply chains through standardized digital systems
- The standard is intended to support organizations, agencies, and stakeholders in the biomass economy, as well as Chain of Custody (CoC) software systems

---

## Who is Involved?

- BOOST welcomes participation from a balanced range of stakeholders, including civil society organizations, government agencies, small and large businesses, and independent technical experts
- Anyone may join this Community Group

---

## What are Data Standards?

- Data standards are agreed-upon approaches that allow for consistent measurement, qualification, or exchange of information
- They provide a structured framework and a common language for organizing, documenting, and formatting data, facilitating aggregation, sharing, and reuse across different systems and organizations

---

## What is Chain of Custody (CoC)?

- Chain of custody refers to the chronological documentation or paper trail showing the movement, handling, and transformation of items
- In the biomass industry, CoC systems provide the framework for tracing biomass from forest or source to final use, ensuring sustainable sourcing and regulatory compliance

---

## How do Data Standards Support CoC?

- CoC software systems rely on robust data standards for accurate tracking, transparency, and compliance across complex supply chains
- Data standards define what information must be captured, how it should be structured, and the rules for data exchange
- They are foundational for enabling effective CoC software by providing the framework for consistent, reliable tracking across complex processes and organizational boundaries
- Data standards enable interoperability, allowing CoC information to flow seamlessly between different organizations and systems in a supply chain
- They provide validation rules necessary to ensure information meets quality and compliance requirements, which is critical for maintaining a defensible chain of custody

---

## Core Components of the CoC Data Standard So Far

- Defines categories and types of biomass
- Define participating entity types: harvesters, processors, etc.
- Support multiple CoC tracking methodologies:
  - Mass balance
  - Physical seperation
  - Crediting
- Provides JSON-based data schemas.

## BOOST as an "Open Origin Standard"

- The full name, Biomass Open Origin Standard for Tracking, emphasizes the intention for the standard to be open
- Research points to the need for a "secure, scalable, open-source, and low-cost chain-of-custody solution" for biomass tracking

---

## Benefits of Openness

- An open standard promotes interoperability between existing traceability systems and enables digital integration across the supply chain
- It facilitates transparency and trust among stakeholders in complex supply chains
- An open development process allows for broad participation from a balanced range of stakeholders, preventing overrepresentation of any single group

---

## Open Process in Practice

- W3C Community Groups are open to all without a membership fee requirement
- Technical work in the BOOST group is conducted in public, utilizing public mail lists and GitHub repositories
- This public process ensures contributions and decisions are transparently tracked

---

## What are W3C Community Groups?

- W3C Community and Business Groups provide a place for developers, designers, and others passionate about the Web to hold discussions and publish ideas
- They are proposed and run by the community itself
- Community Groups are designed to promote innovation and lower barriers to individual participation
- They are open to all, quick to start, public, self-determined, and without a time limit. Participation in a Community Group does not require W3C Membership

## The End

Thanks for watching!
