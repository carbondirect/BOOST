## What is BOOST?

- W3C Community Group 
- v0.1 funded by California Department of Conservation

--

## What is the objective?

*To develop and maintain a robust interoperable data standard for solid biomass comprised of schemas, protocols, and documenation for tracking biomass materials from source to end-use*

--

## WHAT are the goals

*To improve transparency, verification and trust in biomass supply chains*

*Reduce operational costs and increase access to markets for biomass producers and consumers*

--

## Who is involved?

- Anyone!
- stakeholders:
  - NGOs, independent certification bodies 
  - fed/state agencies, 
  - small and large businesses
  - independent technical experts

## Data Standards ??

--
## What are Data Standards?

*Data standards are agreed-upon approaches that allow for consistent measurement, qualification, or exchange of information*

--

## Why develop a Data Standard

Provides a structured framework and a common language for:

- organizing, 
- documenting, 
- formatting **data**
  
Facilitating **aggregation**, **sharing**, and **reuse** across different systems and organizations

--

## What is Chain of Custody (CoC)?

Documentation and recording of:
- movement, 
- handling, 
- transformation 

of material through a supply chain


--

## How do Data Standards Support CoC?

For CoC software, data standards:
  - provide a data framework (entities, attributes, and relationships)
  - provide logic for tracking across complex processes and organizational boundaries
  - enable interoperability between systems
  - provide validation rules
  
--

## Core Components of the CoC Data Standard So Far

- Defines categories and types of biomass
- Define participating entity types: harvesters, processors, etc.
- Support multiple CoC tracking methodologies:
  - Mass balance
  - Physical seperation
  - Crediting
- Provides JSON-based data schemas.

## BOOST as an "Open Origin Standard"

- The full name, Biomass Open Origin Standard for Tracking, emphasizes the intention for the standard to be open
- Research points to the need for a "secure, scalable, open-source, and low-cost chain-of-custody solution" for biomass tracking

---

## Benefits of Openness

- An open standard promotes interoperability between existing traceability systems and enables digital integration across the supply chain
- It facilitates transparency and trust among stakeholders in complex supply chains
- An open development process allows for broad participation from a balanced range of stakeholders, preventing overrepresentation of any single group

---

## Open Process in Practice

- W3C Community Groups are open to all without a membership fee requirement
- Technical work in the BOOST group is conducted in public, utilizing public mail lists and GitHub repositories
- This public process ensures contributions and decisions are transparently tracked

---

## What are W3C Community Groups?

- W3C Community and Business Groups provide a place for developers, designers, and others passionate about the Web to hold discussions and publish ideas
- They are proposed and run by the community itself
- Community Groups are designed to promote innovation and lower barriers to individual participation
- They are open to all, quick to start, public, self-determined, and without a time limit. Participation in a Community Group does not require W3C Membership

## The End

Thanks for watching!
