  abstract = {Traceability is the ability to follow the processes that a raw material or product goes through. For forestry, this means identifying the wood from the standing tree to the mill entrance and recording all information about the technical (production) and spatial (transportation) manipulation of the timber by linking it to the ID. We reviewed the literature for developments in timber flow traceability. Findings range from disillusionment with the non-application of available forestry technology to enthusiasm for the advancement of technology that---given appropriate incentives of an economic, environmental, consumer-oriented and legislative nature---can rapidly lead to widespread end-to-end media-interruption-free implementation. Based on our research, the solution lies in optical biometric systems that identify the individual piece of wood---without attaching anything---at three crucial points: during assortment at the skid road, at the forest road and at the mill entrance. At all of these points, the data accruing during the timber supply process must be linked to the ID of the piece of wood via data management.},

  abstract = {The need to establish new infrastructure for biomass processing has been recommended by several state strategies for California to accomplish its carbon neutrality and forest health goals. However, without a long-term guaranteed supply contract, new facilities are not eligible for loans, debt servicing, or other financing strategies. In 2023, the Watershed Research and Training Center (WRTC) partnered with UC Davis on the use of the Forest Resource and Renewable Energy Decision Support System (FRREDSS)---an integrated optimization tool for least-cost feedstock procurement---to test its effectiveness as a tool to determine long-term feedstock contract prices in a spatial environment. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by summarizing the 20-year profit and loss (P\&L) statement across silvicultural and harvest types, expansion factors, and inflation rates across six (6) site locations within Nevada, Placer, and El Dorado Counties. Site locations were modeled to test the feedstock costs for a 5 MW combined heat and power conversion system with a general average feedstock demand of 35,753 bone dry tons (BDT) per year. Input variables were updated to 2023 market rates across the modeling environment (i.e. diesel price, hauling rate, CPI, etc.). When comparing the average delivered feedstock cost over the 20-year period with reported contractor rates to the Ophir site location, we found that the model was unable to come within 10\% of the reported rates. On a year by year basis, costs where consistently less than reported rates. It wasn't until Year 15 of the 20-year P\&L statement that prices began to exceed reported contractor rates. For this reason, recommendations to improve the FRREDSS model focus on better representing logging constraints in a spatial environment, adding variables to estimate workforce capacity, adding variables to represent subsidies, and to develop an inflation-based index to better represent biomass economics. Ultimately, it is recommended that a new tool be built that is more customized to the end goals of long-term feedstock contract price management. Results developed in this report continue to support the basis for long-term feedstock pricing, but more development is required before cost estimates are within an acceptable range of accuracy to be applied in existing markets.},

  abstract = {This report reviews a collection of literature, conversations, and other sources on a contracting approach for long-term feedstock price management. An illustrative example on a long-term biomass price formula is developed to support discussions. Due to the sensitivity of biomass prices to various interrelated variables such as inflation and diesel prices, identifying a price point throughout the life of the contract is challenging and requires research on suitable market designs to improve price stability, reliability, and risk over time. This research reviews two forward market mechanisms that are used in commodity markets in order to assess their application to the goal of de-risking biomass supply chains. A formulabased rate (FBR) and an index-based price (IBP) formula were both discussed, and a demonstrative index-based pricing approach for forest biomass was created to support discussions. Additionally, a new approach to de-risking biomass supply called a Feedstock Supply Insurance (FSI) is briefly discussed. An FSI model focuses on guaranteeing feedstock delivery and includes aspects of feedstock price forecasting, although this is something separate from biomass price adjustment designs.},
