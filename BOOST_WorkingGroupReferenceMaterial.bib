For forestry, this means identifying the wood from the standing tree to the mill entrance and recording all information about the technical (production) and spatial (transportation) manipulation of the timber by linking it to the ID. We reviewed the literature for developments in timber flow traceability. Findings range from disillusionment with the non-application of available forestry technology to enthusiasm for the advancement of technology that—given appropriate incentives of an economic, environmental, consumer-oriented and legislative nature—can rapidly lead to widespread end-to-end media-interruption-free implementation. Based on our research, the solution lies in optical biometric systems that identify the individual piece of wood—without attaching anything—at three crucial points: during assortment at the skid road, at the forest road and at the mill entrance. At all of these points, the data accruing during the timber supply process must be linked to the ID of the piece of wood via data management.},

This paper reviews how one international supply chain performed and identifies lessons that may be helpful to improve future resilience. Economic and employment data through November 2020 are used to review the effects of COVID-19 on operations of the bioenergy supply chain in the southeastern United States (SE United States) that utilizes wood fiber to fabricate pellets. Conditions associated with the production of pellets in the SE United States changed with the outbreak of COVID-19. Federal and state government programs and classification of workers in this sector as “essential” during the pandemic helped maintain the woody pellet supply chain and other industries during a period of general shut down in 2020. The availability of personal protective equipment, long-term supply contracts, and established safety cultures are among the factors that enhance supply chain resilience while limited availability of skilled workers, inadequate stakeholder engagement, and dependence on external policies are among factors that reduce resilience. The analysis concludes with recommendations for the SE pellet supply chain, and other biomass supply chains, to improve their resilience to future disturbances. When best practices are implemented, SE United States biomass offers opportunities to contribute to post-pandemic economic recovery while incentivizing better forest resource management.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Forests are a major natural resource of the state of California, where over a third of the land is forested, and provide a wide range of environmental, economic, and social benefits. Over the past decade, unprecedented drought, insect outbreaks and wildfires have resulted in large-scale tree mortality that greatly affects the forest ecosystem and poses significant threat to human health and welfare and to the environment. Forest thinning and management is considered imperative to improve forest health and resilience. Forest resources including dead and dying trees as well as the residues produced from forest thinning and timber harvesting operations could potentially be used to a greater degree than at present to generate electricity and other renewable energy to meet the increasing demand for more sustainable supplies and mitigate the risk of wildfires.

  abstract = {In July 2016, the European Commission (EC) published a legislative proposal for incorporating greenhouse gas emissions and removals due to Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) into its 2030 Climate and Energy Framework. The Climate and Energy Framework aims at a total emission reduction of 40\% by 2030 for all sectors together as part of the Paris Agreement. The LULUCF proposal regulates a “no debit” target for LULUCF (Forests and Agricultural soils), and regulates the accounting of any additional mitigation potential that might be expected of it. We find that the forest share of the LULUCF sector can achieve much more than what is in the regulation now. We elaborate a strategy for unlocking European Union (EU) forests and forest sector potential based on the concept of “climate smart forestry” (CSF). We find that to-date, European policy has not firmly integrated forest potential into the EU climate policy framework. Nor have climate objectives been firmly integrated into those of the forest and forest sector at either the EU or national level. Yet a wide range of measures can be applied to provide positive incentives for more firmly integrating these climate objectives into the forest and forest sector framework. With the right set of incentives in place at EU and Member States levels, we find the current literature supports the view that the EU has the potential to achieve an additional combined mitigation impact through CSF of 441 Mt CO2/year by 2050. In addition, CSF, through reducing and/or removing greenhouse gas emissions, adapting and building forest resilience, and sustainably increasing forest productivity and incomes, tackles multiple policy goals.},

  abstract = {Background Traceability of food products has become the focus of regional and national legislation, of many research and technical development initiatives and projects, and of many scientific articles. However, most of the scientific publications do not differentiate between the components of a traceability system, and those who do to some degree use inconsistent terminology and definitions. This weakens the analysis and the conclusions, and it can lead to misunderstanding in relation to what a traceability system is, what the components are, and how system functionality can be improved. Scope and approach This paper provides a structure for describing and analyzing a traceability system and emphasizes the difference between the system mechanisms as opposed to the attributes of the units that are traced. The basis for the classification outlined in this article is practical experience from traceability system implementations in the food industry, and participation in international standardization processes relating to food traceability. The references and the authors’ experience are from the food sector, but the component description is likely to be relevant and applicable to any product traceability system in a supply chain. ‘Traceability system’ is used as a generic term in this article, encompassing the principles, practices, and standards needed to achieve traceability of food products, regardless of how these are implemented. In practice in the food industry, most traceability systems are computerized and they are implemented through extensive use of information and communications technology (ICT), but in principle a traceability system could be manual and paper-based (as was indeed common practice only a few years ago), and the components hierarchy outlined in this article would still be applicable. Key findings and conclusions This paper identifies the general components of a traceability system to be the identification of the units under consideration, the recording of the joining and splitting of these units as they move through the supply chain (the transformations), and the recording of the unit attributes. The distinction between the different components is particularly important when describing and comparing traceability systems, and when recommending improvements. In both these cases, the respective components need to be considered separately.},

  abstract = {The need to establish new infrastructure for biomass processing has been recommended by several state strategies for California to accomplish its carbon neutrality and forest health goals. However, without a long-term guaranteed supply contract, new facilities are not eligible for loans, debt servicing, or other financing strategies. In 2023, the Watershed Research and Training Center (WRTC) partnered with UC Davis on the use of the Forest Resource and Renewable Energy Decision Support System (FRREDSS)—an integrated optimization tool for least-cost feedstock procurement—to test its effectiveness as a tool to determine long-term feedstock contract prices in a spatial environment. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by summarizing the 20-year profit and loss (P\&L) statement across silvicultural and harvest types, expansion factors, and inflation rates across six (6) site locations within Nevada, Placer, and El Dorado Counties. Site locations were modeled to test the feedstock costs for a 5 MW combined heat and power conversion system with a general average feedstock demand of 35,753 bone dry tons (BDT) per year. Input variables were updated to 2023 market rates across the modeling environment (i.e. diesel price, hauling rate, CPI, etc.). When comparing the average delivered feedstock cost over the 20-year period with reported contractor rates to the Ophir site location, we found that the model was unable to come within 10\% of the reported rates. On a year by year basis, costs where consistently less than reported rates. It wasn’t until Year 15 of the 20-year P\&L statement that prices began to exceed reported contractor rates. For this reason, recommendations to improve the FRREDSS model focus on better representing logging constraints in a spatial environment, adding variables to estimate workforce capacity, adding variables to represent subsidies, and to develop an inflation-based index to better represent biomass economics. Ultimately, it is recommended that a new tool be built that is more customized to the end goals of long-term feedstock contract price management. Results developed in this report continue to support the basis for long-term feedstock pricing, but more development is required before cost estimates are within an acceptable range of accuracy to be applied in existing markets.},

An illustrative example on a long-term biomass price formula is developed to support discussions. Due to the sensitivity of biomass prices to various interrelated variables such as inflation and diesel prices, identifying a price point throughout the life of the contract is challenging and requires research on suitable market designs to improve price stability, reliability, and risk over time. This research reviews two forward market mechanisms that are used in commodity markets in order to assess their application to the goal of de-risking biomass supply chains. A formulabased rate (FBR) and an index-based price (IBP) formula were both discussed, and a demonstrative index-based pricing approach for forest biomass was created to support discussions. Additionally, a new approach to de-risking biomass supply called a Feedstock Supply Insurance (FSI) is briefly discussed. An FSI model focuses on guaranteeing feedstock delivery and includes aspects of feedstock price forecasting, although this is something separate from biomass price adjustment designs.},

  abstract = {Regional tree die-off events generate large quantities of standing dead wood, raising concern over catastrophic wildfire and other hazards. Governmental responses to tree die-off have often focused on incentivizing biomass energy production that utilizes standing dead trees removed for safety concerns. However, the full distribution of potential woody bioenergy feedstock after tree die-off has not been evaluated due to the complexities of surveying and precisely measuring large forested areas. In this paper, we present a novel method for estimating standing dead biomass at a fine spatial resolution that combines aerial survey data with forest structure maps. Using this method, we quantify biomass generated by the unprecedented tree die-off that occurred in California following a 4-year drought and widespread pest outbreaks. The results are used to estimate feasibly recoverable feedstock for energy production. We find that approximately 95.1 million bone-dry tons (BDT) of dead biomass resulted from 2012–2017 mortality, with a lower bound of 26.2 million BDT. In other words, of the aboveground live tree biomass in 2012, \textasciitilde 1.3–4.8\% died by 2017. Of the standing dead biomass, 29\% meets minimum constraints for potential cost-effective bioenergy feedstock. This proportion drops to as low as 15\% in the most affected areas due to terrain slope, wilderness status, and other factors, highlighting the need to complement disposal via biomass energy with other strategies to mitigate the risks of the tree mortality crisis, which is likely to only become more severe over time due to climate change.},

  abstract = {Decisions to build biopower facilities, like those for most other infrastructure developments, are made within a complex framework of technical, environmental, ecological, social, political, financial, and economic considerations. With data and prior experience often limited, modeling to explore sensitivities to solution alternatives can help support and contribute to the decision processes, particularly when attempting to quantify technoeconomic and environmental qualifications that affect project feasibility. Biomass resources associated with California’s extreme tree mortality, not only represent major ecological concerns but also represent opportunities to increase renewable energy supplies as part of improved management approaches. Toward this end, a decision support system (DSS) model was developed for lifecycle technoeconomic and environmental assessments that quantify the potential impacts of electricity generation. This web-based Forest Resource and Renewable Energy Decision Support System (FRREDSS) provides site-specific project development guidance on potential feedstock availability, as well as estimated economic and environmental performance. The model enables users to assess short- and longer-term feedstock availability and the potential economic feasibility and environmental impacts of biopower facilities in California. The current resource database derives from the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) national data collection for the Sierra Nevada region. The spatial analysis integral to the model yields proximity to feedstock, landings, and road networks, along with estimated delivered costs of feedstock at the facility, and the overall levelized cost of energy (LCOE) as electricity transmitted to the nearest substation. Included in the spatial analysis are related attributes including defined fire hazard zones where wildfire mitigation may have relevance to project siting. The model provides preliminary information to help inform more detailed engineering, environmental, and other studies critical to the final determination of overall project feasibility and decisions that must be made to proceed. The model is flexible toward future enhancements to expand the types of facilities considered, the available resource data and resource uncertainties, and many other factors influencing decision outcomes.},
