# BOOST Kaulen Framework Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive implementation of the Kaulen framework enhancements to the BOOST data standard, implementing phases 1-3 of the enhancement plan for media-interruption-free timber supply chain traceability, now enhanced with detailed plant part categorization for complete biomass tracking.

## Major Changes Implemented

### 1. Updated Master ERD (`drafts/images/boost_erd.mermaid`)
- **Enhanced with 11 new Phase 1 entities** supporting Kaulen framework requirements
- **Updated all existing entities** with Phase 2 geographic data references and TRU-centric attributes  
- **Implemented comprehensive Phase 3 relationships** for complete traceability integration
- **Replaced MaterialBatch-centric design** with TraceableUnit (TRU) as primary traceable entity

### 2. New Phase 1 Core Entities Created

#### TraceableUnit (Primary TRU)
- **Purpose**: Fundamental unit of traceability (individual log, pile, volume aggregation, processed batch)
- **Key Features**: Biometric identification, multi-species support, parent/child relationships, processing history

#### TrackingPoint (Critical Points)
- **Purpose**: Three critical tracking points (harvest site, skid road, forest road, mill entrance)
- **Key Features**: Equipment tracking, operator assignment, location reference
- **Schema Location**: `/drafts/schema/tracking_point/`

#### BiometricIdentifier (Attachment-Free ID)
- **Purpose**: Optical biometric identification without physical attachments
- **Key Features**: Optical pattern data, multi-species biometrics, capture location

#### Additional Phase 1 Entities (Schema folders to be completed):
- **MeasurementRecord**: TRU dimension tracking at multiple points
- **LocationHistory**: Complete movement tracking with timestamps  
- **DataReconciliation**: Measurement validation between forest and mill
- **Material** (refactored): Reference table for material types
- **Claim** (enhanced): TRU-centric sustainability tracking with species support

### 3. Phase 2 Entity Enhancements Implemented

#### Organization (Enhanced)
- Added equipment/personnel tracking arrays
- Geographic operational area references
- TRU management capabilities
- Infrastructure mapping support

#### Transaction & TransactionBatch (Enhanced)
- TRU array references replacing MaterialBatch dependencies
- Reconciliation status and timeline tracking
- Species composition at transaction time
- Media break detection flags

#### Geographic Data Integration
- All location-aware entities now reference GeographicData
- Supplier, Customer, Certificate, SupplyBaseReport, Audit entities enhanced
- Complete spatial data consistency

#### SupplyBase Entity (Added)
- Infrastructure mapping (harvest sites, skid roads, forest roads)
- Equipment deployment tracking
- TRU origin relationships
- Species availability cataloging

### 4. Phase 3 Relationship Implementation

#### TRU-Centric Relationships
- TraceableUnit → SpeciesComponent (multi-species support)
- TraceableUnit → MaterialProcessing (processing chain)
- TraceableUnit → LocationHistory (movement tracking)
- TraceableUnit → Claim (sustainability claims)
- TraceableUnit → TraceableUnit (parent/child for split/merge)

#### Geographic Data Relationships
- Comprehensive spatial integration across all entities
- Location hierarchy support (harvest sites within supply bases)
- Complete geographic consistency validation

#### Enhanced Transaction Relationships
- TRU-based transaction and batch tracking
- Data reconciliation integration
- Processing event linkage

## Key Kaulen Framework Compliance Features

### 2. Three Critical Tracking Points
- **Harvest site/Skid road**: Initial capture with biometric identification
- **Forest road**: Transport validation and load verification  
- **Mill entrance**: Final reconciliation and quality assessment
- **Equipment integration** at each tracking point

### 3. Optical Biometric Identification
- **Attachment-free wood identification** using optical patterns
- **Multi-species biometric support** for complex piles
- **Capture location and method tracking**
- **Integration with tracking point equipment**

### 4. Complete Species Composition Tracking

- **Biodiversity compliance reporting**

### 5. TRU Split/Merge Operations
- **Parent/child relationship tracking** for genealogy
- **Volume conservation enforcement** in all operations
- **Claim inheritance** through processing operations

### 6. Plant Part Categorization System (NEW)
- **Comprehensive plant taxonomy** - 17 standardized plant parts (trunk, heartwood, sapwood, bark, branches, etc.)
- **Material-level specifications** - Plant parts included/excluded per material type
- **Species-level composition** - Volume/percentage breakdown by plant part within species
- **Processing transformations** - Plant part changes during processing operations
- **Value optimization** - Route processing based on plant part composition
- **Circular economy tracking** - Byproduct and waste stream management
- **Quality differentiation** - Premium grading for specific plant parts (e.g., heartwood vs sapwood)

## Implementation Status

## Usage Guidelines

### For TRU-Based Traceability
1. Create TraceableUnit as primary entity
2. Add SpeciesComponent entities for multi-species TRUs
3. Track processing through MaterialProcessing entities
4. Maintain LocationHistory for complete movement tracking
5. Use BiometricIdentifier for attachment-free identification

### For Geographic Data Integration
1. Create GeographicData entities for all locations
2. Reference geographic data from all location-aware entities
3. Maintain spatial consistency across relationships
4. Validate location hierarchies (sites within supply bases)

### For Sustainability Claims
1. Link Claims directly to TraceableUnit entities
2. Track species-specific claims through SpeciesComponent
3. Maintain claim inheritance through parent/child TRU relationships
4. Validate certification scheme compliance

## Breaking Changes and Migration

### MaterialBatch Deprecation
- **Impact**: MaterialBatch entity deprecated in favor of TraceableUnit
- **Migration**: Existing MaterialBatch data must be converted to TraceableUnit format
- **Timeline**: Gradual migration with parallel support period

### Claim Entity Refactoring  
- **Impact**: Claims now reference TraceableUnit instead of TransactionBatch
- **Migration**: Update claim references and add species-specific support
- **Enhancement**: Added claim inheritance and expiry tracking

### Enhanced Relationships
- **Impact**: Many entities now require geographic data references
- **Migration**: Add geographic data for existing entities
- **Validation**: Enhanced referential integrity requirements
