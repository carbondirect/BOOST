* Working Group

A working group for the development of version ~0.1~ of the data standard is recommended: 

1. **Diverse Expertise**: A working group brings together stakeholders with varied knowledge - forestry specialists, supply chain experts, data scientists, sustainability certification professionals, and industry representatives. This diversity ensures the standard addresses all relevant aspects of biomass tracking.

2. **Industry Buy-in**: Development through a working group creates stakeholder ownership and increases the likelihood of widespread adoption. When industry players participate in creating the standard, they're more invested in its success.

3. **Practical Feasibility**: Direct input from implementers ensures the standard will be practical and implementable across different operational contexts and technical capabilities.

4. **Interoperability Considerations**: Participants can identify existing systems and standards that need to interface with your biomass standard, ensuring compatibility from the start.

5. **Governance Structure**: A working group can establish governance procedures for maintaining and updating the standard after initial development.

6. **Transparency**: Open development processes build credibility and trust in the resulting standard, particularly important for chain of custody applications where verification is key.

7. **Shared Resources**: Members can contribute resources, test implementations, and provide real-world validation scenarios.

8. **Problem Identification**: Practitioners can identify edge cases and complications that might not be obvious to a smaller development team.

This collaborative approach is especially valuable for biomass chain of custody tracking, which spans multiple industries (forestry, transportation, energy, manufacturing) and requires coordination across diverse stakeholders to create a truly useful and widely adopted standard.



* Platform Recommendation Based on Priorities

Priorities:

1. Ease of use  across a broad range of technical abilities,
2. Overhead in administration of the process
3. Time frame for implementation to an initial draft standard

** Framework Recommendation

W3C Community Group approach would balance structure with accessibility and timeline
   - Faster path to first draft (3-6 months)
   - Flexible enough to accommodate diverse participants
   - Lower administrative overhead than formal SDOs

** Implementation strategy
   - Start with GitHub + Slack combination for core collaboration
   - Use Google Docs for initial drafting to maximize accessibility
   - Transition documents to GitHub as they mature
   - Consider adding more formal processes if/when the standard gains traction

This combination provided a balance of accessibility for non-technical participants while establishing enough structure to move efficiently toward a draft standard within a reasonable timeframe (approximately 4-6 months for an initial draft).


* Appendix1: Frameworks for Working Group Organization: Pros and Cons
** OASIS Model
*** Pros
    - Highly structured process with established credibility in standards development
    - Clear governance mechanisms reduce conflicts and decision bottlenecks
    - Results in standards that are more likely to be widely recognized and adopted
    - Provides ready-made templates for charters, processes, and voting procedures
    - Good for complex technical standards that require formal industry recognition
*** Cons
    - Higher administrative overhead to establish and maintain
    - Can be intimidating for non-technical participants
    - Longer timeline to first draft (typically 6-12 months)
    - May include membership fees or formal organizational requirements
    - More rigid structure can slow down iterations

** W3C Community Group Structure
*** Pros
    - Lower barrier to entry than formal SDOs
    - Flexible and adaptable to the group's needs
    - Can produce a first draft more quickly (typically 3-6 months)
    - More accessible to participants with varied technical backgrounds
    - Can later be transitioned to a more formal process if needed
    - Free to establish and participate in
*** Cons
    - Less formal recognition compared to established SDOs
    - Requires more "from scratch" organization as it's less prescriptive
    - May need more active facilitation to maintain momentum
    - Can be harder to resolve contentious issues without formal processes

** Standards Development Organization (SDO) Approach
*** Pros
    - Highest level of industry recognition and adoption potential
    - Well-defined processes for versioning and maintaining standards
    - Clear path to formal publication and recognition
    - Robust intellectual property frameworks protect contributors
    - Good for standards intended for regulatory alignment
*** Cons
    - Highest administrative overhead and formality
    - Longest timeline to first draft (often 12+ months)
    - May require significant resources to participate
    - Can be challenging for non-experts to navigate
    - Less agile than more informal approaches

* Appendix 2: Collaboration Platform Evaluation
** GitHub
*** Ease of use
    Moderate. Intuitive for developers but presents a learning curve for non-technical participants. The web interface makes basic contributions possible without technical knowledge.
*** Administrative overhead
    Low-moderate. Repository setup is straightforward, but managing permissions and workflows requires some technical knowledge.
*** Implementation timeline
    Quick setup (days). Can begin collaborative drafting immediately.

** Confluence + Jira
*** Ease of use
    Good for most users. Familiar document-centric approach is accessible to non-technical participants. Jira can be complex but is configurable to simplify.
*** Administrative overhead
    Moderate. Requires setup of spaces, templates, and workflows. Ongoing administration for user management and organization.
*** Implementation timeline
    Medium setup (1-2 weeks). Requires configuration before effective collaboration.

** Communication Tools (Slack/Discord + Mailing Lists)
*** Ease of use
    High. Most participants will be familiar with email and chat interfaces.
*** Administrative overhead
    Low. Simple to set up channels and mailing lists.
*** Implementation timeline
    Quick setup (days). Immediate communication possible.
