# Phase 1 California Agency Meeting Invitations
## BOOST Development Engagement Sessions - July 2025

---

### Email 1: California Air Resources Board (CARB)

**To:** Marieke Fenton, Jeremy Loeb  
**CC:** Carmen Meialua  
**Subject:** BOOST Development Input Session - LCFS Integration Opportunity

Hi Marieke and Jeremy,

Hope you're both doing well! As you know from our W3C Community Group discussions, we're making great progress on the BOOST data standard. We'd love to get your detailed input to help shape the technical specifications before we finalize the framework.

Would you be available for a 90-minute development session in July? We're particularly excited to explore how BOOST can streamline LCFS compliance and support the enhanced verification requirements coming in 2026-2028. Your expertise on carbon intensity calculations and pathway verification would be invaluable.

The session would focus on gathering CARB's technical requirements and integration preferences - we want to make sure BOOST works seamlessly with your existing systems and actually makes your lives easier!

Let me know what works for your calendars. Happy to meet at CARB offices in Sacramento or do this virtually, whatever's most convenient.

Looking forward to collaborating!

Best,  
Peter

### Email 2: Department of Conservation

**To:** Elizabeth Betancourt  
**Subject:** BOOST Development Session - Leveraging Our Partnership

Hi Elizabeth,

Thanks again for the Department's support of our stakeholder analysis work - it's been incredibly valuable in understanding the coordination challenges across agencies.

Given our existing partnership, I'd love to get the Department's input on BOOST development from a resource assessment and environmental coordination perspective. Would you be available for a 90-minute development session in July?

We're particularly interested in how BOOST could integrate with your geological and resource mapping databases, and support environmental permitting coordination across agencies. Your insights could really help us build something that serves the broader resource management community.

Since you've been funding this work, I think you'll find it exciting to see how the standard is taking shape and provide input on the technical direction.

Let me know what works best for your schedule!

Best,  
Peter

### Email 3: California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA)

**To:** Nina Bingham  
**Subject:** BOOST Development Input - Privacy-First Agricultural Design

Hi Nina,

Hope things are going well at CDFA! I know you've been following BOOST development through our mailing list updates. We're at a point where we'd really value your input on the technical design, especially around agricultural biomass classification.

Would you be available for a 90-minute development session in July? We want to make sure we get the privacy protections right from the start - I know Virginia Jameson raised important concerns about farmer data sensitivity, and we want to build those protections into the core architecture.

This would be a great opportunity to shape how BOOST handles agricultural data, food vs. fuel classifications, and integration with existing CDFA systems. Your input could really help us create something that serves agricultural producers while protecting their privacy.

Happy to meet at CDFA offices or virtually, whatever works better for you.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,  
Peter

### Email 4: CalFire

**To:** Kevin Welch  
**Subject:** BOOST Development Session - CALTREES Integration Opportunity

Hi Kevin,

Hope you're doing well! I know you've been following our BOOST updates. We're at an exciting stage where we're gathering detailed input from agencies to refine the technical specifications.

Would you be interested in a 90-minute development session in July? We're particularly excited about integrating with CALTREES and supporting THP tracking. I think there's a real opportunity to quantify fire risk reduction through biomass removal, which could be valuable for both forest management and policy discussions.

Your insights on contractor oversight, High Hazard Zone tracking, and forest management requirements would be incredibly helpful in shaping the standard. We want to make sure BOOST actually supports CalFire's mission rather than creating another reporting burden.

Let me know what works for your calendar - happy to meet at CalFire offices or do this virtually.

Looking forward to collaborating!

Best,  
Peter

### Email 5: California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC)

**To:** Jazmin Melendez  
**Subject:** BOOST Development Input - BioRAM Reconciliation Solution

Hi Jazmin,

Hope you're doing well! I know you've been following BOOST development through our community updates. We're at a stage where we'd love to get CPUC's detailed input on technical requirements.

Would you be available for a 90-minute development session in July? From our stakeholder analysis, we understand that staff spend considerable time reconciling BioRAM filings from different utility spreadsheets - this sounds like exactly the kind of challenge BOOST could help solve.

We'd love your input on automated reconciliation requirements, enhanced verification protocols (especially with R.18-07-003), and integration with existing CPUC systems. Your perspective could really help us build something that makes compliance monitoring more efficient.

Happy to meet at CPUC offices in San Francisco or do this virtually, whatever's more convenient.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,  
Peter

### Email 6: CalRecycle

**To:** Dan Brown  
**Subject:** BOOST Development Session - RDRS Integration & Circular Economy

Hi Dan,

Hope things are going well at CalRecycle! I know you've been following our BOOST updates, and I think there's a really exciting opportunity for waste-to-energy integration.

Would you be available for a 90-minute development session in July? We're particularly interested in how BOOST could integrate with RDRS to eliminate duplicate reporting for waste-to-energy facilities, and support comprehensive circular economy biomass flow tracking.

Your input on waste stream classification, municipal solid waste biomass components, and existing recycling program integration would be incredibly valuable. We want to make sure BOOST supports CalRecycle's circular economy goals rather than creating additional reporting burden.

Let me know what works for your schedule - happy to meet at CalRecycle offices or virtually.

Looking forward to collaborating!

Best,  
Peter
