#+TITLE: BOOST Data Standard: Executive Summary for CalFire
#+SUBTITLE: Enhanced Integration with THP Database and Fire Risk Systems

\maketitle

* Overview

The Biomass Open Origin Standard for Tracking (BOOST) is a comprehensive data standard developed by the W3C Community Group to enable transparent, verifiable tracking of biomass materials through supply chains. BOOST directly supports CalFire's mission of protecting California's natural resources by providing standardized frameworks for forest biomass utilization, fire risk reduction, and sustainable forest management.

Based on stakeholder analysis, BOOST's integration with CalFire's robust CALTREES database and Timber Harvest Plans (THP) system provides the foundation for comprehensive forest biomass tracking. The existing spatial data infrastructure through CalFire's Forest Practice GIS hub, combined with established sustainability criteria for BioMAT programs, creates an ideal framework for enhanced cross-agency coordination and automated compliance reporting.
