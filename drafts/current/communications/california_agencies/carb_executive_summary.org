\maketitle

* Overview

The Biomass Open Origin Standard for Tracking (BOOST) is a comprehensive data standard developed by the W3C Community Group to enable transparent, verifiable tracking of biomass materials through supply chains. BOOST directly supports CARB's Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) program by providing the integrated, standards-based data architecture that recent stakeholder analysis identifies as critical for reducing administrative burden while improving compliance effectiveness.

Based on the California Department of Conservation's interagency coordination analysis, BOOST addresses the core challenge of fragmented systems that force operators to reconcile data across CARB's LCFS interface, CalRecycle's RDRS, Energy Commission fuel reports, and other agency portals through manual, error-prone processes.

* Key Benefits for CARB

** Streamlined LCFS Compliance
- *Automated Carbon Intensity Calculations*: BOOST's EnergyCarbonData entity enables real-time GHG emissions tracking and automated CI calculations for biomass pathways, addressing the current challenge of manual data reconciliation across multiple regulatory portals
- *Enhanced Pathway Verification*: Certificate and Audit entities provide comprehensive third-party verification frameworks aligned with LCFS requirements, including support for the 2026 geographical data and attestation requirements and 2028 third-party certification mandates
- *Mass Balance Integration*: BOOST's MassBalanceAccount entity directly supports LCFS mass or energy balance requirements for tracing feedstock attributes across supply chains
- *Open Access Compliance*: Built-in API architecture provides the open access to operational systems required for third-party verifiers and CARB auditors

** Improved Program Oversight
- *Real-Time Monitoring*: Live data feeds enable continuous monitoring of LCFS pathway compliance rather than periodic reporting, replacing current labor-intensive, fragmented audit processes
- *Enhanced Audit Capabilities*: Complete supply chain visibility improves audit effectiveness and reduces compliance costs through automated documentation and audit-ready lineage
- *Data Quality Assurance*: Built-in validation and verification requirements ensure higher quality GHG data while reducing manual reconciliation errors
- *End-to-End Traceability*: Automated tracking system supports multiple overlapping regulations and audit requirements

** System Integration Opportunities
- *LCFS Database Integration*: BOOST APIs can integrate directly with existing CARB systems for seamless data exchange, eliminating duplicate data entry across agency portals
- *Credit Trading Enhancement*: MassBalanceAccount entity supports automated LCFS credit calculation and trading with real-time compliance monitoring
- *Multi-Program Coordination*: Shared data infrastructure supports coordination with other CARB programs (Cap-and-Trade, etc.) through unified data architecture
- *Cross-Agency Data Exchange*: Automated APIs enable data sharing with CalFire's THP database, CPUC's BioRAM tracking, and other state systems

* Current CARB Engagement

*Active Participants*:
- Marieke Fenton (W3C Community Group Member)
- Jeremy Loeb (W3C Community Group Member) 
- Carmen Meialua (Mailing List Participant)

*Engagement Level*: High - CARB staff are already actively participating in BOOST technical development and providing regulatory expertise, positioning CARB as the most technically engaged agency in the BOOST development process.
