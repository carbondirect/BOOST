\maketitle

* Overview

The Biomass Open Origin Standard for Tracking (BOOST) is a comprehensive data standard developed by the W3C Community Group to enable transparent, verifiable tracking of biomass materials through supply chains. BOOST supports CDFA's mission to protect and promote California agriculture by providing standardized frameworks for agricultural biomass utilization while ensuring food security and sustainable farming practices.

 
* Key Potential Benefits for CDFA

Software and data-powered tools that incorporate BOOST have the potential to support CDFAs mission more efficiently and effectively.
