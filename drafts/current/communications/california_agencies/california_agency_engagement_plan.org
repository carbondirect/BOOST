#+TITLE: California Agency Engagement Plan for BOOST Data Standard Review
#+SUBTITLE: Enhanced Strategy Based on Interagency Coordination Analysis

\maketitle

* Executive Summary

This plan outlines a targeted two-phase approach to engage six key California agencies in reviewing the BOOST data standard and exploring areas of program overlap. Phase 1 (July 2025) involves a focused sprint of individual 90-minute meetings with each agency to actively engage them in BOOST development. Phase 2 (August-September 2025) focuses on follow-up meetings to develop pilot programs and implementation planning.

Based on comprehensive stakeholder analysis revealing current challenges with fragmented systems, manual reconciliation across multiple agency portals, and administrative burden on regulated entities, this enhanced engagement strategy emphasizes BOOST's unified data architecture as the solution to identified pain points. The plan leverages existing agency infrastructure (CalFire's CALTREES database, CARB's LCFS systems, CPUC's BioRAM tracking, CalRecycle's RDRS system, Department of Conservation's resource databases) while addressing privacy concerns and cross-jurisdictional coordination needs.
