#+TITLE: BOOST Data Standard: Executive Summary for California Public Utilities Commission
#+SUBTITLE: Enhanced BioRAM and BioMAT Integration with Automated Reconciliation

\maketitle

* Overview

The Biomass Open Origin Standard for Tracking (BOOST) is a comprehensive data standard developed by the W3C Community Group to enable transparent, verifiable tracking of biomass materials through supply chains. BOOST directly supports CPUC's renewable energy oversight mission by providing standardized frameworks for biomass energy procurement tracking, renewable portfolio standard (RPS) compliance, and utility performance monitoring.

Based on stakeholder analysis highlighting CPUC staff spending substantial time reconciling quarterly and annual BioRAM filings from incompatible utility spreadsheets, BOOST's unified data architecture addresses the core challenge of manual reconciliation across multiple regulatory portals. The system's automated compliance reporting capabilities directly support CPUC's exploration of stronger third-party verification protocols under Rulemaking R.18-07-003.
