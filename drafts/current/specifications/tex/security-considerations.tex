\subsection{Data Privacy}
\label{sec:data-privacy}

Implementations \SHOULD{} consider privacy implications of biomass tracking data:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Location data may reveal sensitive commercial information
    \item Biometric identifiers require secure storage and transmission
    \item Personal operator information needs appropriate access controls
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Integrity}
\label{sec:data-integrity}

Critical security measures include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Digital signatures for high-value transactions
    \item Audit trails for all data modifications
    \item Backup and recovery procedures for critical supply chain data
    \item Validation of external data sources and certificates
\end{itemize}

\begin{important}[title=Security Implementation Requirements]
Implementations \MUST{} address authentication of supply chain participants, authorization controls for data access, secure communication channels, and fraud detection mechanisms.
