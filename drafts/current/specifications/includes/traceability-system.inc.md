The BOOST Traceability System implements a revolutionary approach to biomass supply chain tracking that eliminates the traditional weak points where traceability is lost during material transfers and processing operations.

## Key Implementation Features

### Media-Interruption-Free Traceability
TraceableUnit (TRU) entities maintain continuous identification through biometric signatures and optical pattern recognition, eliminating dependency on physical tags or attachments that can be lost or damaged during handling and processing operations.

### Three Critical Tracking Points
The system establishes standardized measurement and verification infrastructure at:
- **harvest_site** - Initial TRU creation with biometric capture and volume measurement
- **skid_road/forest_road** - Transportation consolidation points with reconciliation validation
- **mill_entrance** - Processing facility entry points with final verification before transformation

### Multi-Species Support
Species-specific tracking capabilities enable:
- Individual species identification within mixed material flows
- Species-specific sustainability claim application and inheritance
- Detailed composition tracking with percentage validation
- Regulatory compliance for jurisdiction-specific species requirements

### Complete Processing Chain Documentation
MaterialProcessing entities provide comprehensive audit trails by:
- Linking input TRUs to output TRUs for every transformation
- Tracking plant part changes and transformations during processing
- Validating volume and mass conservation across processing steps
- Supporting split and merge operations with complete genealogy tracking
