BOOST addresses critical use cases across the biomass supply chain, from forest management and harvesting through processing, transportation, and final delivery. The standard supports both regulatory compliance and voluntary certification scenarios.

## Core Use Case Categories

### 1. Complete Harvest-to-Mill Traceability Chain

**Objective**: Verify end-to-end traceability from standing tree to mill processing

**Key Steps**:
- **Initial TRU Creation** at harvest site with biometric identification
- **Critical Tracking Points** validation (harvest_site → skid_road → forest_road → mill_entrance)
- **Volume Conservation** verification across transportation and handling
- **Processing Integration** with input/output TRU relationships
- **Audit Trail Generation** for complete supply chain documentation

### 2. Multi-Species Mixed Material Processing

**Objective**: Track individual species within mixed material flows

**Key Features**:
- Individual species identification within TRUs marked `isMultiSpecies: true`
- SpeciesComponent entities with detailed plant part composition
- Species-specific sustainability claim application and inheritance
- Percentage validation ensuring composition totals equal 100%
- Processing transformations with species-level tracking

### 3. California LCFS Regulatory Compliance

**Objective**: Generate quarterly LCFS compliance reports with complete audit trails

**Integration Points**:

The LCFS compliance workflow demonstrates how BOOST tracking data flows directly into credit generation. When lumber mill residue arrives at a renewable fuel facility, TraceableUnit entities capture the material's origin, volume, moisture content, and FSC Chain of Custody certification. This tracking data validates that the feedstock meets the requirements for pathway CA-RD-2025-LMR-001.

As the material moves through processing, MaterialProcessing entities document the conversion of 50 tons of biomass into 1,250 gallons of renewable diesel. This tracked conversion ratio provides the foundation for volume reconciliation that CARB requires. The Transaction entity then links the fuel volume to both the certified pathway and the tracked feedstock, creating an unbroken chain of documentation from biomass to credits.

The quarterly LCFSReporting entity aggregates these tracked transactions to calculate total credits. Using the documented fuel volume of 1,250 gallons and the pathway CI validated through feedstock tracking, the system generates 155,125 credits valued at approximately $31,025. The entire calculation depends on the underlying tracking data that proves feedstock eligibility, documents chain of custody, and reconciles material flows.

### 4. Multi-Certification Scheme Management

**Objective**: Maintain multiple certification claims across processing operations

**Capabilities**:
- Single TRU supporting multiple claims (FSC, SBP, PEFC, ISCC)
- Claim inheritance through MaterialProcessing operations
- Species-specific claim application within mixed materials
- Third-party verification with evidence documentation
- Chain of custody validation across organizational boundaries

### 5. Flexible Identification Supporting Current and Future Methods

**Objective**: Maintain continuous traceability using current industry practices and emerging technologies

**Current Industry Integration**:
- Trip ticket systems with unique delivery numbers as TraceableUnit identifiers
- RFID tag integration for automated tracking and equipment identification
- QR code systems linking to existing documentation and record systems
- Paper-based documentation workflows with manual identifier capture

**Technical Features**:
- IdentificationMethod catalog supporting all current and future approaches
- Media break detection and flagging mechanisms for data continuity
- Multiple identifier redundancy (trip tickets + RFID + QR codes)
- Forward compatibility with emerging biometric pattern recognition
- Seamless integration with legacy transportation and documentation systems

### 6. Plant Part Value Optimization

**Objective**: Optimize material routing based on plant part composition

**Economic Applications**:
- High-value heartwood routing to lumber markets
- Intermediate sapwood direction to structural applications
- Byproduct utilization (bark, branches, processing residues)
- Zero-waste processing with complete component accounting
- Circular economy integration with waste stream minimization

## Stakeholder-Specific Use Cases

### Forest Management Organizations
- **Harvest Planning** with sustainability claim optimization
- **Certification Maintenance** across multiple schemes (FSC, SFI)
- **Supply Base Reporting** for regulatory compliance
- **Equipment Integration** with harvester-mounted measurement systems

### Processing Facilities
- **Material Flow Optimization** based on plant part composition
- **Quality Control** with measurement reconciliation
- **Processing Chain Documentation** for audit requirements
- **Volume Conservation** validation with tolerance checking

### Transportation Companies
- **Chain of Custody Maintenance** across organizational boundaries
- **Location History** documentation for all TRU movements
- **Trip Ticket Integration** with existing delivery documentation workflows
- **Real-time Tracking** integration with transportation systems  
- **Arrival Verification** with measurement validation

**Trip Ticket Workflow Example**:
1. Driver receives trip ticket: `TRIP-2025-001234` with load details
2. BOOST creates TraceableUnit with `uniqueIdentifier: "TRIP-2025-001234"`
3. Additional TRU fields capture enhanced tracking data (species, volume, location)
4. Delivery confirmation links trip ticket to destination processing facility
5. Complete audit trail maintained without changing current documentation practices

### Regulatory Agencies
- **Compliance Monitoring** with automated report generation
- **Audit Trail Access** for verification and enforcement
- **Cross-jurisdictional** data exchange and validation
- **Sustainability Verification** with third-party evidence

### Certification Bodies
- **Multi-scheme Support** with standardized data formats
- **Audit Trail Integration** for verification processes
- **Claim Validation** with species-specific applicability
- **Evidence Documentation** with tamper-proof data integrity
