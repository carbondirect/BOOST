BOOST addresses critical use cases across the biomass supply chain, from forest management and harvesting through processing, transportation, and final delivery. The standard supports both regulatory compliance and voluntary certification scenarios.

## Core Use Case Categories

### 1. Complete Harvest-to-Mill Traceability Chain

**Objective**: Verify end-to-end traceability from standing tree to mill processing

**Key Steps**:
- **Initial TRU Creation** at harvest site with biometric identification
- **Critical Tracking Points** validation (harvest_site → skid_road → forest_road → mill_entrance)
- **Volume Conservation** verification across transportation and handling
- **Processing Integration** with input/output TRU relationships
- **Audit Trail Generation** for complete supply chain documentation

### 2. Multi-Species Mixed Material Processing

**Objective**: Track individual species within mixed material flows

**Key Features**:
- Individual species identification within TRUs marked `isMultiSpecies: true`
- SpeciesComponent entities with detailed plant part composition
- Species-specific sustainability claim application and inheritance
- Percentage validation ensuring composition totals equal 100%
- Processing transformations with species-level tracking

### 3. California LCFS Regulatory Compliance

**Objective**: Generate quarterly LCFS compliance reports with complete audit trails

**Integration Points**:
- Enhanced Organization entities with LCFS registration data
- Transaction entities linked to CARB-certified pathways
- EnergyCarbonData with lifecycle assessment integration
- LCFSReporting entities for quarterly submission preparation
- Credit/deficit position tracking with automated calculations

### 4. Multi-Certification Scheme Management

**Objective**: Maintain multiple certification claims across processing operations

**Capabilities**:
- Single TRU supporting multiple claims (FSC, SBP, PEFC, ISCC)
- Claim inheritance through MaterialProcessing operations
- Species-specific claim application within mixed materials
- Third-party verification with evidence documentation
- Chain of custody validation across organizational boundaries

### 5. Progressive Identification and Continuous Traceability

**Objective**: Maintain continuous traceability without physical tag dependencies

**Technical Features**:
- Optical pattern recognition of grain, bark, or cut surfaces
- BiometricIdentifier entities with tamper-proof signatures
- Media break detection and flagging mechanisms
- Backup identification methods (RFID, QR codes) for redundancy
- Data continuity validation across all processing steps

### 6. Plant Part Value Optimization

**Objective**: Optimize material routing based on plant part composition

**Economic Applications**:
- High-value heartwood routing to lumber markets
- Intermediate sapwood direction to structural applications
- Byproduct utilization (bark, branches, processing residues)
- Zero-waste processing with complete component accounting
- Circular economy integration with waste stream minimization
