# Regulatory Program Compliance # {#regulatory-compliance}

The BOOST standard provides comprehensive support for regulatory compliance across multiple biofuel programs, with primary focus on the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). This section documents programmatic reporting workflows, compliance requirements, and implementation guidance for regulatory submissions.

## Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) Overview ## {#lcfs-overview}

The California Low Carbon Fuel Standard, administered by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), is a market-based regulation designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels. BOOST provides specialized entities and validation rules to support complete LCFS compliance workflows.

### Regulatory Context ### {#lcfs-regulatory-context}

The LCFS program requires regulated parties to:

- Track all fuel transactions with certified pathway attribution
- Calculate carbon intensity using CARB-approved methodologies
- Submit quarterly reports with complete audit trails
- Maintain third-party verification documentation
- Demonstrate compliance with sustainability criteria

### BOOST's Role in LCFS Compliance ### {#boost-lcfs-role}

BOOST enables LCFS compliance through:

- **Pathway Management**: `LcfsPathway` entity for CARB-certified pathways
- **Transaction Tracking**: Enhanced `Transaction` with LCFS-specific fields
- **Quarterly Reporting**: `LcfsReporting` entity for regulatory submissions
- **Credit Calculations**: Automated credit/deficit calculation with validation
- **Audit Trail**: Complete traceability from feedstock to fuel product

## LCFS Entity Integration ## {#lcfs-entities}

### LcfsPathway Entity ### {#lcfspathway-entity}

The `LcfsPathway` entity manages CARB-certified fuel pathways:

- `pathwayId`: CARB-assigned pathway identifier
- `pathwayType`: Lookup Table, Tier 1, or Tier 2 pathway
- `carbonIntensity`: Certified CI value (gCO2e/MJ)
- `energyEconomyRatio`: EER for credit calculation
- `certificationDate`: CARB certification date
- `expirationDate`: Pathway expiration date
- `verificationStatus`: Active, suspended, or expired
- `caGreetVersion`: CA-GREET model version used

**Pathway Validation Rules:**

- Pathway must be active for transaction date
- Carbon intensity must match CARB database
- Feedstock must align with pathway specifications
- Facility location must match certified production site

### Enhanced Transaction Entity ### {#enhanced-transaction}

LCFS-specific transaction fields include:

- `lcfsPathwayId`: Foreign key to certified pathway
- `fuelVolume`: Volume in gallons or GGE
- `fuelCategory`: Fuel type classification
- `reportingPeriod`: YYYY-Q# format
- `regulatedPartyRole`: Producer, importer, blender, or distributor

### LcfsReporting Entity ### {#lcfsreporting-entity}

Quarterly reporting aggregation:

- `reportingPeriod`: Quarter identifier (e.g., "2025-Q1")
- `totalFuelVolume`: Aggregate fuel volume
- `totalCreditsGenerated`: Credits from CI below benchmark
- `totalDeficitsIncurred`: Deficits from CI above benchmark
- `netPosition`: Net credit/deficit position
- `verificationStatus`: Third-party verification status

## Programmatic Reporting Workflows ## {#lcfs-workflows}

### Quarterly Report Generation ### {#quarterly-reports}

The quarterly reporting process follows these steps:

1. **Transaction Aggregation**: Collect all transactions for reporting period
2. **Pathway Validation**: Verify pathway status and attributes
3. **Credit Calculation**: Apply CARB formulas with EER adjustment
4. **Report Generation**: Create structured report for submission
5. **Verification**: Third-party review if required
6. **Submission**: Upload to CARB reporting system

### Credit Calculation Methodology ### {#credit-calculation}

LCFS credits are calculated using the formula:

```
Credits = (Benchmark CI - Pathway CI) × Fuel Volume × Energy Density × EER × 10^-6
```

Where:
- Benchmark CI = CARB-specified carbon intensity target
- Pathway CI = Certified pathway carbon intensity
- Fuel Volume = Transaction volume in gallons
- Energy Density = MJ per gallon for fuel type
- EER = Energy Economy Ratio for application

### Data Reconciliation Process ### {#data-reconciliation}

Monthly reconciliation ensures data integrity:

1. Compare transaction records with physical inventory
2. Validate pathway assignments against production records
3. Cross-check credit calculations with manual verification
4. Document discrepancies in `DataReconciliation` entity
5. Generate reconciliation report for audit trail

## Implementation Examples ## {#lcfs-examples}

### Renewable Diesel Production Example ### {#renewable-diesel-example}

Complete workflow for renewable diesel with forest residue feedstock:

<pre class="json">
{
  "transactionId": "TXN-LCFS-2025Q1-001",
  "transactionType": "fuel_sale",
  "fuelVolume": 10000,
  "fuelVolumeUnit": "gallons",
  "fuelCategory": "renewable_diesel",
  "lcfsPathwayId": "PATH-CARB-RD-001",
  "reportingPeriod": "2025-Q1",
  "organizationId": "ORG-PACIFIC-001",
  "regulatedPartyRole": "producer",
  "traceableUnitIds": ["TRU-FOREST-001", "TRU-FOREST-002"],
  "carbonIntensity": 35.5,
  "benchmarkCI": 94.17,
  "creditsGenerated": 5862.5
}
</pre>

### Credit Calculation Example ### {#credit-calc-example}

Using actual CARB values for renewable diesel:

- Fuel Volume: 10,000 gallons
- Energy Density: 129.65 MJ/gallon (renewable diesel)
- Benchmark CI: 94.17 gCO2e/MJ (2025 diesel target)
- Pathway CI: 35.50 gCO2e/MJ (certified pathway)
- EER: 1.0 (heavy-duty diesel application)

**Calculation:**
```
Credits = (94.17 - 35.50) × 10,000 × 129.65 × 1.0 × 10^-6
        = 58.67 × 10,000 × 129.65 × 10^-6
        = 7,607 MT CO2e credits
```

## Technical Implementation ## {#lcfs-technical}

### API Endpoints for LCFS Data ### {#lcfs-api}

RESTful API design for LCFS operations:

- `GET /lcfs/pathways` - Retrieve active pathways
- `POST /lcfs/transactions` - Submit fuel transaction
- `GET /lcfs/reports/{period}` - Generate quarterly report
- `POST /lcfs/credits/calculate` - Calculate credits/deficits
- `GET /lcfs/reconciliation/{period}` - Reconciliation report

### Automated Report Generation ### {#automated-reports}

Python implementation for quarterly reports:

```python
from boost_client import create_client
from datetime import datetime

client = create_client()

# Generate Q1 2025 LCFS report
report = client.generate_lcfs_report(
    reporting_period="2025-Q1",
    organization_id="ORG-PACIFIC-001"
)

# Aggregate transactions by pathway
pathway_summary = report.aggregate_by_pathway()

# Calculate total credits/deficits
total_credits = sum(t.credits for t in report.transactions)
total_deficits = sum(t.deficits for t in report.transactions)
net_position = total_credits - total_deficits

# Generate CARB submission format
carb_report = report.format_for_carb_submission()

# Export to required XML format
report.export_to_xml("lcfs_2025_q1_submission.xml")
```

### Error Handling and Validation ### {#error-handling}
