The Biomass Open Origin Standard for Tracking (BOOST) data standard defines a comprehensive, interoperable framework for tracking biomass materials through complex supply chains. BOOST enables transparent, verifiable, and consistent data exchange to support sustainability verification, regulatory compliance, and supply chain integrity across the biomass economy.

This specification provides implementers with the technical details needed to deploy BOOST-compliant tracking systems, including entity schemas, validation rules, and integration patterns with existing certification and regulatory frameworks.

## Community Development Process ## {#community-process}

BOOST is developed through the [BOOST W3C Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/boost-01/) with collaborative input from industry stakeholders, regulatory agencies, and technical experts. The standard implements a TraceableUnit (TRU)-centric model supporting continuous tracking with progressive identification methods, multi-species composition management, and comprehensive plant part categorization across 36 interconnected entities.

**Working Group Leadership:**

## TraceableUnit-Centric Architecture ## {#tru-architecture}

The BOOST data model organizes around the **TraceableUnit (TRU)** as the foundational entity, reflecting the operational reality that biomass tracking fundamentally concerns following specific physical units through supply chain transformations.

### **Entity Relationship Hierarchy**

All 33 BOOST entities serve one of four core functions relative to TraceableUnits:

1. **TRU Creation Entities**: `Material`, `SpeciesComponent`, `BiometricIdentifier` - establish initial TRU identity
2. **TRU Modification Entities**: `MaterialProcessing`, `Transaction`, `TransactionBatch` - transform or transfer TRUs
3. **TRU Measurement Entities**: `MeasurementRecord`, `MoistureContent`, `TrackingPoint` - capture TRU state data
4. **TRU Context Entities**: `GeographicData`, `Operator`, `Equipment` - provide operational context

This architecture ensures that every data element in BOOST directly supports traceability objectives while avoiding redundant or disconnected information structures.

### **Critical Tracking Point Implementation**

BOOST defines three critical tracking points that correspond to actual physical locations where custody changes or aggregation occurs:

- **harvest_site**: Geographic location where biomass is initially harvested and first TRU is created
- **skid_road/forest_road**: Intermediate aggregation points where multiple harvest TRUs may be consolidated before transport
- **mill_entrance**: Final delivery point where TRUs transition from transportation to processing operations

These tracking points represent the physical bottlenecks where traditional systems lose traceability due to material mixing or transfer between different tracking systems.

## Biometric Implementation Framework ## {#biometric-implementation}

### **Current Technology Landscape**

BOOST's biometric identification framework is designed to work with emerging computer vision technologies for wood identification:

**Available Technologies**:
- **End-grain Photography**: Log cross-section imaging with pattern recognition algorithms (Ravindran2022, USDA Forest Service)
- **Wood Grain Analysis**: Surface texture recognition using machine learning classification (Hwang2021, Plant Methods)
- **Geometric Profiling**: Combined dimension and visual signature identification (Ergun2024, PMC)

**Implementation Readiness**: While full commercial deployment is still developing, controlled environment demonstrations show sufficient accuracy for pilot implementations. BOOST provides the data structure framework to capture biometric data as the technology scales.

### **Fallback Identification Methods**

BOOST supports multiple identification approaches to accommodate varying technology deployment levels:

- **Primary**: Biometric signatures captured through computer vision systems
- **Secondary**: RFID or QR code tags for operations not ready for biometric implementation
- **Hybrid**: Combination approaches using both biometric and traditional marking systems for validation

The `BiometricIdentifier` entity structure accommodates all identification methods while maintaining forward compatibility as biometric technology matures.

## Regulatory Compliance Integration ## {#regulatory-integration}

### **Multi-Framework Data Strategy**

BOOST's field structure enables single-system compliance with multiple regulatory programs through strategic data element combinations:

**California LCFS Integration**:
- Volume tracking: `TraceableUnit.totalVolumeM3` aggregated across supply chain stages
- Carbon intensity: `LCFSPathway.pathwayCI` combined with `EnergyCarbon.benchmarkCI`
- Feedstock verification: `SupplyBase` data linked to `GeographicData` location validation

**Federal RFS Integration**:
- Renewable identification: `Material.materialCategory` with `SpeciesComponent.species` composition
- D-code classification: Automated based on feedstock type and processing pathway
- Volume reporting: `Transaction.quantityM3` with automated unit conversions

**EU RED-II Integration**:
- Sustainability criteria: `CertificationScheme` and `Certificate` validity tracking
- Land use verification: `GeographicData` with `SupplyBase.supplyBaseType` classification
- GHG calculations: `EnergyCarbon.ghgEmissions` across all processing stages

### **Automated Documentation Generation**

BOOST implementations can automatically generate regulatory compliance documents by:

1. **Data Aggregation**: Collecting relevant fields across linked TRUs for reporting periods
2. **Calculation Automation**: Computing required metrics (CI values, volume conversions, GHG totals)
3. **Format Transformation**: Converting BOOST data into regulatory-specific formats (LCFS Quarterly Reports, RFS Annual Compliance, EU Sustainability Verification)

This approach eliminates manual report preparation while ensuring consistency across regulatory frameworks.
