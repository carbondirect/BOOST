The Biomass Open-Source Traceability (BOOST) data standard defines a comprehensive, interoperable framework for tracking biomass materials through complex supply chains. BOOST enables transparent, verifiable, and consistent data exchange to support sustainability verification, regulatory compliance, and supply chain integrity across the biomass economy.

## Community Development Process ## {#community-process}

BOOST is developed through the [BOOST W3C Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/boost-01/) with collaborative input from industry stakeholders, regulatory agencies, and technical experts. The standard implements a TraceableUnit (TRU)-centric model supporting media-interruption-free tracking, multi-species composition management, and comprehensive plant part categorization across 33 interconnected entities.

**Working Group Leadership:**
- **Chair:** Peter Tittmann (Carbon Direct)
