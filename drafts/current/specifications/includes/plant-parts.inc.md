The plant part categorization system enables detailed tracking of biomass components through processing operations, supporting value optimization and circular economy principles.

## Introduction and Regulatory Context

The BOOST plant part categorization framework addresses critical regulatory and operational requirements across multiple jurisdictions and applications. This system provides the taxonomic foundation for distinguishing product classifications from physical arrangements, enabling sophisticated supply chain optimization and regulatory compliance.

### Regulatory Drivers

**California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) Requirements**
- Agricultural biomass classification for food vs. fuel categorization
- Privacy protections for farmer data in agricultural residue tracking
- Integration with existing CDFA biomass certification systems
- Support for agricultural waste stream optimization programs

**Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) Compliance**
- Feedstock categorization requirements for carbon intensity calculations
- Plant part composition tracking for pathway verification
- Biogenic carbon accounting across different material components
- Alternative fate assessment support for BECCS applications

**Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) Integration**
- Chain of custody tracking through plant part transformations
- Controlled wood verification for different plant components
- Multi-species composition documentation requirements
- Value recovery optimization across plant part classifications

### Conceptual Framework

The BOOST system distinguishes between two fundamental attributes:

**Product Classification vs. Physical Arrangement**
- **Product Classification**: Market destination or intended use (sawlog, pulpwood, biomass, chips)
- **Physical Arrangement**: Spatial organization affecting collection and decomposition (scattered, piled, windrow, stacked)

This distinction enables sophisticated LCA and BECCS analysis by capturing both economic intent and operational reality. Physical arrangement directly impacts:
- Collection efficiency factors
- Decomposition rates for alternative fate modeling
- Carbon sequestration implications
- Energy requirements for harvest operations

### Implementation Benefits

**Economic Value Optimization**
- Route high-value heartwood to lumber markets
- Direct structural sapwood to appropriate applications
- Optimize biomass utilization from residue streams
- Maximize value recovery through detailed categorization

**Environmental Compliance**
- Support greenhouse gas accounting across plant part categories
- Enable alternative fate assessments for BECCS analysis
- Track biogenic carbon through processing transformations
- Document environmental impact mitigation strategies

## System Overview

### 17 Standardized Plant Parts Taxonomy
The BOOST standard defines a comprehensive taxonomy of plant components:

**Primary Structural Components:**
- **trunk** - Main stem/bole of tree (primary commercial value)
- **heartwood** - Inner, non-living wood (high-value lumber applications)
- **sapwood** - Outer, living wood (structural applications)
- **bark** - Protective outer layer (often processed separately)

**Secondary Structural Components:**
- **branches** - Secondary stems (various size classes)
- **twigs** - Small branches (biomass and chip applications)
- **roots** - Below-ground structures (specialty applications)
- **stump** - Remaining base after felling (often left on-site)

**Photosynthetic and Reproductive Components:**
- **leaves** - Photosynthetic organs (deciduous trees)
- **needles** - Coniferous leaves (evergreen trees)
- **foliage** - All leaf matter (aggregate category)
- **cones** - Seed-bearing structures (coniferous trees)
- **seeds** - Reproductive structures (genetic resources)
- **crown** - Above-ground branching structure (aggregate category)

**Processed Components:**
- **chips** - Mechanically processed fragments (uniform size classes)
- **sawdust** - Fine processing residue (byproduct utilization)
- **pellets** - Densified processed material (energy applications)

### Processing Transformations
The system tracks detailed transformations during processing operations:
- **Input composition** - Plant part percentages entering processing
- **Output composition** - Plant part percentages in processed materials
- **Transformation methods** - Processing techniques applied
- **Efficiency metrics** - Material recovery and waste generation
- **Byproduct routing** - Secondary material stream management

### Value Optimization Applications
Plant part categorization enables sophisticated material routing:
- **High-value applications** - Route heartwood to lumber markets
- **Intermediate-value uses** - Direct sapwood to structural applications  
- **Biomass applications** - Utilize branches, bark, and processing residues
- **Specialty markets** - Extract high-value compounds from specific plant parts

### Circular Economy Integration
The system supports comprehensive waste stream management:
- **Zero-waste processing** - Account for all plant part components
- **Byproduct utilization** - Track secondary use applications
- **Waste stream minimization** - Optimize processing efficiency
- **Economic value attribution** - Calculate value by plant part composition

## Physical Arrangement Framework

The BOOST system captures spatial organization of biomass materials to support collection planning and LCA analysis. Physical arrangement significantly affects both operational efficiency and environmental impact assessment.

### Arrangement Categories

**Scattered Arrangement**
- Crowns and branches distributed across forest floor after harvesting
- Lower collection efficiency (typically 65-75%)
- Higher decomposition rates due to ground contact and weather exposure
- Alternative fate: natural decomposition or wildfire fuel

**Centralized Piles**  
- Material gathered into specific collection points for efficiency
- High collection efficiency (typically 90-95%)
- Moderate decomposition rates depending on pile construction
- Optimized for mechanical loading and transport operations

**Windrow Configuration**
- Linear arrangements following equipment access patterns
- Collection efficiency 80-90% with mechanical systems
- Balanced decomposition rates with partial ground contact
- Enables efficient forwarding and chipping operations

**Stacked Arrangements**
- Organized vertical stacking for drying and storage
- Highest collection efficiency (95%+) with quality preservation
- Lowest decomposition rates when properly ventilated
- Premium applications requiring controlled moisture content

### LCA and BECCS Integration

**Alternative Fate Modeling**
- Baseline scenario assessment (decomposition, wildfire, prescribed burning)
- Arrangement-specific decomposition rates for carbon accounting
- Emissions avoided calculations based on collection vs. baseline
- Soil carbon impact assessment from ground contact patterns

**Collection Efficiency Factors**
- Energy requirements for different arrangement patterns
- Equipment accessibility and operational constraints
- Volume recovery rates by arrangement and terrain conditions
- Economic optimization through arrangement planning

**Carbon Sequestration Implications**
- Soil carbon changes from different contact patterns
- Biogenic carbon release rates by exposure conditions
- Long-term carbon storage in processed vs. unprocessed material
- Integration with BECCS project alternative fate requirements
