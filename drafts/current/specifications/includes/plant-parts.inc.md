The plant part categorization system enables detailed tracking of biomass components through processing operations, supporting value optimization and circular economy principles.

## System Overview

### 17 Standardized Plant Parts Taxonomy
The BOOST standard defines a comprehensive taxonomy of plant components:

**Primary Structural Components:**
- **trunk** - Main stem/bole of tree (primary commercial value)
- **heartwood** - Inner, non-living wood (high-value lumber applications)
- **sapwood** - Outer, living wood (structural applications)
- **bark** - Protective outer layer (often processed separately)

**Secondary Structural Components:**
- **branches** - Secondary stems (various size classes)
- **twigs** - Small branches (biomass and chip applications)
- **roots** - Below-ground structures (specialty applications)
- **stump** - Remaining base after felling (often left on-site)

**Photosynthetic and Reproductive Components:**
- **leaves** - Photosynthetic organs (deciduous trees)
- **needles** - Coniferous leaves (evergreen trees)
- **foliage** - All leaf matter (aggregate category)
- **cones** - Seed-bearing structures (coniferous trees)
- **seeds** - Reproductive structures (genetic resources)
- **crown** - Above-ground branching structure (aggregate category)

**Processed Components:**
- **chips** - Mechanically processed fragments (uniform size classes)
- **sawdust** - Fine processing residue (byproduct utilization)
- **pellets** - Densified processed material (energy applications)

### Processing Transformations
The system tracks detailed transformations during processing operations:
- **Input composition** - Plant part percentages entering processing
- **Output composition** - Plant part percentages in processed materials
- **Transformation methods** - Processing techniques applied
- **Efficiency metrics** - Material recovery and waste generation
- **Byproduct routing** - Secondary material stream management

### Value Optimization Applications
Plant part categorization enables sophisticated material routing:
- **High-value applications** - Route heartwood to lumber markets
- **Intermediate-value uses** - Direct sapwood to structural applications  
- **Biomass applications** - Utilize branches, bark, and processing residues
- **Specialty markets** - Extract high-value compounds from specific plant parts

### Circular Economy Integration
The system supports comprehensive waste stream management:
- **Zero-waste processing** - Account for all plant part components
- **Byproduct utilization** - Track secondary use applications
- **Waste stream minimization** - Optimize processing efficiency
- **Economic value attribution** - Calculate value by plant part composition
