Abstract: The Biomass Open Origin Standard for Tracking (BOOST) data standard defines a comprehensive, interoperable framework for tracking biomass materials through complex supply chains. BOOST enables transparent, verifiable, and consistent data exchange to support sustainability verification, regulatory compliance, and supply chain integrity across the biomass economy. The standard implements a TraceableUnit (TRU)-centric model supporting media-interruption-free tracking, multi-species composition management, and comprehensive plant part categorization across 33 interconnected entities organized into 7 thematic areas.

## Core Components ## {#python-core-components}

### SchemaLoader ### {#python-schema-loader}

The **SchemaLoader** (`schema_loader.py`) is the foundation component that provides dynamic schema loading and model generation:

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic Schema Discovery**: Scans directories for `validation_schema.json` files
- **Dynamic Model Generation**: Creates Pydantic models from JSON schemas at runtime
- **Enum Generation**: Dynamically creates Python enums from schema definitions
- **Relationship Discovery**: Analyzes schemas to discover foreign key relationships automatically
- **Primary Key Detection**: Identifies primary key fields from schema patterns

**Usage Example:**

```python
from schema_loader import SchemaLoader

# Initialize with automatic schema discovery
loader = SchemaLoader()

# Get dynamically generated Pydantic models
OrganizationModel = loader.get_model('organization')
TraceableUnitModel = loader.get_model('traceable_unit')

# Get enum values directly from current schemas
org_types = loader.get_field_enum_values('organization', 'organizationType')
print(f"Available organization types: {org_types}")

# Access relationship information discovered from schemas
relationships = loader.get_relationships('traceable_unit')
primary_key = loader.get_primary_key('organization')
```

### DynamicBOOSTValidator ### {#python-validator}

The **DynamicBOOSTValidator** (`dynamic_validation.py`) provides comprehensive, schema-driven validation using configuration-based business rules:

**Validation Categories:**
1. **Schema Validation**: JSON Schema compliance and structural validation
2. **Volume/Mass Conservation**: Physical conservation laws with configurable tolerance checking
3. **Temporal Logic**: Date/time consistency rules and processing sequence validation
4. **Geographic Logic**: Location-based constraints and transport distance validation
5. **Species Composition**: Biological consistency and percentage validation
6. **Certification Logic**: Chain of custody validation and certificate integrity
7. **Regulatory Compliance**: LCFS, EU RED, and sustainability criteria validation
8. **Economic/Quality Logic**: Market constraints and quality assurance validation

**Usage Example:**

```python
from dynamic_validation import DynamicBOOSTValidator

validator = DynamicBOOSTValidator()

# Schema validation against current schema
is_valid, errors = validator.validate_entity("organization", org_data)

# Configuration-driven business logic validation
is_valid, errors = validator.validate_business_logic("material_processing", processing_data)

# Comprehensive cross-entity validation
entities = {
    'organization': [org1, org2],
    'traceable_unit': [tru1, tru2],
    'transaction': [txn1]
}
results = validator.comprehensive_validation(entities)
```

### BOOSTClient ### {#python-client}

The **BOOSTClient** (`boost_client.py`) provides a high-level interface that uses the dynamic models and validation system:

**Core Functions:**
- **Entity Creation**: Create entities using dynamically generated models with automatic validation
- **Schema Introspection**: Query available entities, enums, and constraints from current schemas
- **Supply Chain Analysis**: Trace relationships and analyze supply chains using dynamic models
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation using all dynamic rules and business logic
- **JSON-LD Support**: Export/import with semantic annotations and context management

**Usage Example:**

```python
from boost_client import create_client

# Initialize client with dynamic schema loading
client = create_client()

# Schema introspection
schema_info = client.get_schema_info()
print(f"Available entities: {schema_info['available_entities']}")

# Dynamic enum discovery
org_types = client.get_available_enum_values('organization', 'organizationType')

# Entity creation with schema validation
org = client.create_organization(
    organization_id="ORG-FOREST-001",
    name="Pacific Forest Products",
    org_type="harvester",  # Validated against current schema
    contact_email="ops@pacificforest.com"
)

# Comprehensive validation
validation = client.validate_all()
if validation['valid']:
    print("✓ All entities pass validation!")
```

## Dynamic Schema Adaptation ## {#python-schema-adaptation}

A key strength of the Python implementation is its **automatic adaptation to schema changes**. Most schema modifications require **no code changes**:

### Automatically Handled Changes ### {#python-auto-changes}

**Adding New Fields:**
- New optional fields are immediately available
- Required fields trigger validation updates automatically
- Default values from schemas are applied automatically

**Adding New Enum Values:**
- New enum values become available immediately after schema reload
- Validation rules update automatically
- No code changes required

**Adding New Entity Types:**
- New schema files are discovered automatically
- Dynamic models are generated on first access
- All validation rules apply automatically

**Modifying Business Logic Rules:**
- Configuration file changes are applied automatically
- Tolerance values and thresholds update dynamically
- Cross-entity validation rules adapt to changes

### Schema Change Detection ### {#python-change-detection}

The system provides built-in tools for schema change management:

```python
# Check current schema status
client = create_client()
schema_info = client.get_schema_info()

# Validate against current schema
validation = client.validate_all()
if not validation['valid']:
    print("Schema changes detected - validation errors:")
    for error in validation['errors']:
        print(f"  - {error}")

# Refresh schemas after updates
client.refresh_schemas()
```

- **Schema.org Vocabulary** for semantic annotations
- **W3C PROV Ontology** for provenance tracking

# Business Logic Validation # {#business-logic}

Implementations MUST validate entities against 8 categories of business rules to ensure data consistency, regulatory compliance, and supply chain integrity throughout the BOOST traceability system.

NOTE: The [Python reference implementation](#python-implementation) provides a comprehensive example of all business logic validation categories with configuration-driven rules.

## Core Validation Categories ## {#core-validation-categories}

### Volume/Mass Conservation ### {#volume-mass-conservation}
Physical conservation laws MUST be enforced across all processing operations:
- Input volume/mass MUST equal output volume/mass plus documented losses
- Volume loss reasons MUST be specified (moisture loss, defect removal, processing waste)
- Mass balance calculations MUST validate within acceptable tolerance ranges
- Split operations MUST conserve total volume across all resulting TraceableUnits

### Temporal Logic ### {#temporal-logic}
Date and time consistency validation MUST ensure chronological accuracy:
- Processing dates MUST follow logical sequence (harvest → transport → processing)
- Certificate validity periods MUST encompass all related transactions
- TraceableUnit creation dates MUST precede all processing operations
- Location history timestamps MUST maintain chronological order

### Geographic Logic ### {#geographic-logic}
Spatial relationship validation MUST verify location consistency:
- TraceableUnit locations MUST be within operational boundaries of responsible Organization
- Transport routes MUST connect valid origin and destination points
- Harvest locations MUST align with Organization's certified operational areas
- Processing facilities MUST be authorized for specific material types

### Species Composition ### {#species-composition}
Percentage validation for multi-species materials MUST enforce mathematical consistency:
- All SpeciesComponent percentages MUST sum to exactly 100%
- Individual species percentages MUST be greater than 0% and less than or equal to 100%
- Species composition changes through processing MUST be documented and validated
- Mixed-species claims MUST be supported by appropriate certification

### Certification Logic ### {#certification-logic}
Chain of custody validation MUST ensure certification integrity:
- All Organizations MUST possess valid certificates for their role and materials
- Certificate scopes MUST cover the specific materials and operations performed
- Certification claims MUST not exceed the certified percentage of input materials
- Certificate expiration dates MUST not precede transaction completion dates

### Regulatory Compliance ### {#regulatory-compliance}
Jurisdiction-specific rules MUST be enforced based on operational location:
- LCFS pathway requirements MUST be validated for California operations
- Species-specific regulations MUST be enforced for protected or restricted materials
- Import/export requirements MUST be verified for cross-border transactions
- Regional certification requirements MUST be met for specific market destinations

### Economic Logic ### {#economic-logic}
Price and payment validation MUST ensure commercial reasonableness:
- Transaction prices MUST fall within acceptable market range for material type and quality
- Payment terms MUST align with standard industry practices
- Currency conversions MUST use appropriate exchange rates and dates
- Volume-based pricing MUST correlate with documented material quantities

### Quality Assurance ### {#quality-assurance}
Material quality constraints MUST be enforced throughout the supply chain:
- Material quality grades MUST be appropriate for intended end use
- Moisture content levels MUST meet specification requirements
- Quality degradation through processing MUST be documented and validated
- Quality improvement claims MUST be supported by appropriate processing documentation

## Implementation Requirements ## {#validation-implementation-requirements}

All BOOST conforming implementations MUST:
- Validate data against ALL applicable business logic categories
- Provide clear error messages for validation failures
- Support configurable validation rules for jurisdiction-specific requirements
- Maintain validation audit trails for compliance verification
- Enable batch validation for bulk data operations

Validation failures MUST prevent data acceptance and clearly indicate the specific rule violations to enable corrective action.

# Serialization and Exchange # {#serialization}

<pre class=include>
path: includes/serialization.inc.md
</pre>

## JSON-LD as Primary Format ## {#json-ld}

### What is JSON-LD? ### {#json-ld-overview}

JSON for Linking Data (JSON-LD) is a lightweight Linked Data format built on top of JSON that provides a way to express Linked Data using JSON syntax. Unlike standard JSON, JSON-LD includes semantic context that makes data self-describing and machine-interpretable across different systems and organizations.

Key characteristics of JSON-LD:
- **JSON-compatible**: Any valid JSON-LD document is also valid JSON
- **Context-driven**: Uses `@context` to define semantic meaning of terms
- **Linked Data**: Enables creation of a Web of Data through IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifiers)
- **Interoperable**: Facilitates data exchange between heterogeneous systems

### Why BOOST Uses JSON-LD ### {#json-ld-rationale}

BOOST adopts JSON-LD as its primary serialization format to address critical challenges in biomass supply chain data exchange:

#### Semantic Interoperability #### {#semantic-interoperability}
Traditional JSON lacks semantic context, making it difficult for different organizations to exchange data without extensive coordination. JSON-LD's semantic context ensures that:
- Field meanings are precisely defined across all participants
- Data structures are self-documenting and machine-interpretable
- Integration with existing systems requires minimal custom mapping

#### Supply Chain Integration #### {#supply-chain-integration}
Biomass supply chains involve diverse participants (harvesters, processors, certifiers, regulators) using different systems:
- **Forestry companies** using forest management software
- **Processing facilities** with manufacturing execution systems
- **Certification bodies** with audit and compliance platforms
- **Regulatory agencies** with reporting and monitoring systems

JSON-LD enables seamless data flow between these heterogeneous systems without requiring proprietary APIs or custom integration points.

#### Regulatory Compliance #### {#regulatory-compliance}
Multiple jurisdictions have different reporting requirements:
- **California LCFS** requires specific carbon intensity data
- **EU REDII** mandates sustainability criteria verification  
- **FSC/SFI/PEFC** certification schemes have unique data requirements

JSON-LD's semantic flexibility allows the same core data to satisfy multiple regulatory frameworks simultaneously.

#### Future-Proofing #### {#future-proofing}
As new regulations, technologies, and participants enter the biomass ecosystem:
- **Extensibility**: New properties can be added without breaking existing implementations
- **Versioning**: Context evolution maintains backward compatibility
- **Standards alignment**: Integration with emerging W3C and industry standards

### JSON-LD Benefits in BOOST ### {#json-ld-benefits}

#### Enhanced Data Exchange #### {#enhanced-data-exchange}
```json
{
  "@context": "https://boost-standard.org/context/v1",
  "@type": "TraceableUnit", 
  "@id": "https://forestco.example/tru/LOG-001",
  "traceableUnitId": "TRU-LOG-CA-042",
  "totalVolumeM3": 25.5,
  "harvesterId": "https://forestco.example/org/HARVESTER-001",
  "materialTypeId": "https://boost-standard.org/materials/douglas-fir"
}
```

This example demonstrates how JSON-LD makes BOOST data:
- **Self-describing**: The `@context` provides complete semantic definitions
- **Globally unique**: IRIs ensure no identifier conflicts across organizations
- **Linkable**: References to other entities use resolvable URIs
- **Interoperable**: Standard JSON parsers can process the data structure

#### Cross-System Compatibility #### {#cross-system-compatibility}
Organizations can:
- **Consume data** using existing JSON processing tools
- **Validate semantics** using JSON-LD processors
- **Transform data** using SPARQL queries and RDF tools
- **Integrate systems** without custom mapping layers

#### Knowledge Graph Integration #### {#knowledge-graph-integration}
JSON-LD enables transformation to RDF triples for:
- **Complex queries** across supply chain relationships
- **Data analytics** using graph databases and machine learning
- **Compliance verification** through automated reasoning
- **Supply chain visualization** with graph analysis tools

### Technical Requirements ### {#json-ld-technical-requirements}

BOOST data MUST be serializable to [[JSON-LD11]] format with:
- Valid `@context` referencing BOOST context definition
- Entity `@type` declarations matching schema names  
- Unique `@id` values for all entities using IRI format
- Property mappings consistent with BOOST vocabulary definitions

#### JSON-LD Context Structure #### {#json-ld-context-structure}
```json
{
  "@context": {
    "@version": 1.1,
    "@base": "https://boost-standard.org/",
    "boost": "https://boost-standard.org/vocab/",
    "TraceableUnit": "boost:TraceableUnit",
    "traceableUnitId": "boost:traceableUnitId",
    "totalVolumeM3": {
      "@id": "boost:totalVolumeM3",
      "@type": "xsd:decimal"
    },
    "harvesterId": {
      "@id": "boost:harvesterId", 
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  }
}
```

## Context Definitions ## {#context-definitions}

The BOOST JSON-LD context MUST define:

### Vocabulary Mappings ### {#vocabulary-mappings}
- **Entity types**: All BOOST entities mapped to vocabulary IRIs
- **Property definitions**: Field semantics with appropriate data types
- **Relationship properties**: Foreign key mappings for linked data navigation
- **Enumeration values**: Controlled vocabularies for standardized terms

### Data Type Specifications ### {#data-type-specifications}
- **Primitive types**: Strings, numbers, booleans with XSD type mappings
- **Complex types**: Dates, timestamps, geographic coordinates
- **Reference types**: Entity references using `@id` and `@type`
- **Collection types**: Arrays and nested objects with proper context

### Internationalization Support ### {#internationalization-support}
- **Language tags**: Multi-language content using `@language`
- **Regional variations**: Context adaptations for different jurisdictions
- **Cultural considerations**: Date formats, measurement units, naming conventions

### Implementation Guidelines ### {#implementation-guidelines}

#### Context Management #### {#context-management}
Implementations SHOULD:
- Cache BOOST context definitions for performance
- Validate context consistency across data exchanges
- Support context versioning for backward compatibility
- Handle context evolution gracefully

#### Data Processing #### {#data-processing}
Systems MUST:
- Preserve JSON-LD structure during data transformations
- Maintain semantic consistency during data aggregation
- Support both compact and expanded JSON-LD forms
- Enable RDF serialization when required for compliance
