# ERD Thumbnail Image Required

## File Needed: `erd-navigator-thumbnail.png`

An ERD thumbnail image is needed for the documentation. This should be a screenshot of the ERD Navigator showing:

- All 33 BOOST entities positioned in the diagram
- Thematic color coding for the 7 entity areas
- Clear visibility of entity relationships and connections
- Professional appearance suitable for documentation

## Specifications:
- **Dimensions**: Approximately 1200x800 pixels (3:2 aspect ratio)
- **Format**: PNG with transparency support
- **Quality**: High resolution suitable for both web and print
- **Content**: Complete ERD Navigator view with all entities visible

## How to Generate:
1. Open the ERD Navigator in a browser: `erd-navigator/index.html`
2. Zoom to show all entities clearly
3. Take a high-resolution screenshot
4. Crop and optimize as `erd-navigator-thumbnail.png`
5. Place in this `images/` directory

The thumbnail will be used in the ERD Integration section of the BOOST specification documentation to provide a visual preview before users click to launch the interactive navigator.
