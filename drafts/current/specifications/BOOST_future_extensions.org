* Overview

This document captures potential future extensions to the BOOST data standard that would expand its applicability beyond pure biomass supply chains to include multi-material composite products, embodied carbon tracking, and advanced manufacturing processes. These extensions represent significant expansions of BOOST's current scope and are documented for future consideration as the standard evolves.

** Current BOOST Scope
- Pure biomass supply chain tracking (forest to fuel/product)
- Single-material processing chains
- Regulatory compliance (LCFS, RFS, FSC, etc.)
- Chain-of-custody for organic materials

** Proposed Extended Scope
- Multi-material composite products (engineered wood, bio-composites)
- Non-biomass material integration (adhesives, fasteners, treatments)
- Complete embodied carbon accounting (cradle-to-gate/grave)
- Advanced manufacturing processes (lamination, curing, assembly)
- Building industry applications (CLT, mass timber, prefab)

* Use Case Analysis: Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) Embodied Carbon

** Background
Cross-laminated timber represents a complex multi-material product where biomass (wood) is combined with synthetic materials (adhesives) and metal components (fasteners) to create a structural building product. Tracking the embodied carbon of such products requires:

1. Biomass component tracking (wood layers)
2. Non-biomass material integration (adhesives, fasteners)
3. Manufacturing process carbon accounting
4. Composite product composition tracking
5. End-to-end lifecycle carbon calculations

** Current BOOST Limitations

*** Material Scope Limitations
- ~Material~ entity limited to biomass categories (softwood, hardwood, mixed)
- No support for synthetic materials (adhesives, sealants, coatings)
- No support for metal components (fasteners, brackets, hardware)
- No chemical composition tracking for non-biomass materials

*** Processing Limitations  
- ~MaterialProcessing~ entity only handles single TRU input → single TRU output
- No multi-material input processing (wood + adhesive + fasteners → composite)
- Process types limited to biomass operations (felling, chipping, etc.)
- No support for manufacturing processes (lamination, pressing, curing)

*** Product Composition Limitations
- No entity to track composite product composition percentages
- No way to aggregate embodied carbon from multiple material sources
- No engineering properties tracking for final products
- No certification status tracking for composite products

** Gap Analysis Summary

| Capability                  | Current BOOST  | Required for CLT | Gap Level |
|-----------------------------+----------------+------------------+-----------|
| Wood component tracking     | ✓ Full support | ✓ Adequate       | None      |
| Adhesive material tracking  | ✗ No support   | ✓ Critical       | High      |
| Metal component tracking    | ✗ No support   | ✓ Important      | High      |
| Multi-material processing   | ✗ No support   | ✓ Critical       | High      |
| Composite product tracking  | ✗ No support   | ✓ Critical       | High      |
| Embodied carbon aggregation | ✗ No support   | ✓ Critical       | High      |

* Conclusion

The extension of BOOST to support multi-material composite products represents a significant expansion of the standard's scope and impact potential. While current BOOST handles approximately 40% of CLT embodied carbon tracking requirements, the proposed extensions would enable comprehensive tracking of composite wood products from raw materials through end-of-life.

The implementation roadmap provides a structured approach to developing these capabilities over 24 months with a total investment of $1.1M. The projected benefits include enabling carbon credits for the wood products industry, reducing LCA costs, and supporting the growth of mass timber construction.

Key success factors include:
1. Strong industry partnerships for validation and adoption
2. Integration with existing standards and certification systems  
3. Phased implementation to manage technical complexity
4. Focus on interoperability with manufacturing and construction systems

This extension would position BOOST as the comprehensive standard for tracking embodied carbon in building materials, supporting the construction industry's transition to lower-carbon materials and enabling new carbon credit mechanisms for sustainable building practices.
