### Technology Readiness Levels

The `technologyReadinessLevel` field uses the standard TRL 1-9 scale:

1. **TRL 1-3 (Research)**: Basic principles, concept formulation, proof of concept
2. **TRL 4-6 (Development)**: Laboratory validation, relevant environment testing, demonstration
3. **TRL 7-9 (Deployment)**: Prototype demonstration, system complete, proven operational

### Identification Method Types

1. **Biometric**
    - Optical wood fingerprinting and pattern recognition
    - End-grain analysis and bark texture identification
    - Machine learning-based species and individual identification
    - High accuracy but requires advanced equipment and processing

2. **RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)**
    - Electronic tags attached to TRUs
    - Automatic reading capabilities at checkpoints
    - Durable and weather-resistant options available
    - Established technology with high reliability

3. **QR Code**
    - Quick Response matrix barcodes
    - Smartphone-readable with standard apps
    - Cost-effective and easily implemented
    - Requires line-of-sight scanning

4. **Barcode** 
    - Traditional linear barcodes (Code 128, Code 39)
    - Widely supported scanning infrastructure
    - Low cost and simple implementation
    - Limited data capacity compared to QR codes

5. **Manual ID**
    - Human-readable identifiers (batch numbers, lot codes)
    - Spray-painted or etched markings
    - No equipment required for reading
    - Vulnerable to weathering and wear

6. **Photo Documentation**
    - Digital photographs with metadata
    - Visual verification and manual matching
    - Smartphone-based capture and storage
    - Human-readable backup to other methods

7. **Hybrid**
    - Combination of multiple identification methods
    - Primary method with fallback alternatives
    - Enhanced reliability through redundancy
    - Context-dependent method selection

### Location Suitability Assessment

Methods are evaluated for effectiveness at different tracking points:

1. **Harvest Site**
    - Outdoor environment, limited infrastructure
    - Weather exposure and durability requirements
    - Mobile equipment and battery life considerations

2. **Skid Road / Forest Road**
    - Transportation checkpoint applications
    - Vehicle-mounted scanning systems
    - Dust and vibration resistance needs

3. **Mill Entrance**
    - Gate control and verification systems
    - High-volume processing requirements
    - Integration with weighing and measurement

4. **Processing Facility**
    - Indoor controlled environment
    - Integration with production line equipment
    - Real-time tracking and sorting applications

### Implementation Cost Categories

1. **Low**: Minimal equipment investment, existing infrastructure compatible
2. **Medium**: Moderate equipment costs, some specialized hardware required
3. **High**: Significant technology investment, training requirements
4. **Very High**: Advanced systems, substantial infrastructure changes needed

### Regulatory Framework Compatibility

The system tracks which regulatory frameworks accept each identification method:

- **CARB LCFS**: California Low Carbon Fuel Standard
- **EPA RFS**: EPA Renewable Fuel Standard
- **EUDR**: EU Deforestation Regulation
- **FSC**: Forest Stewardship Council
- **PEFC**: Programme for Endorsement of Forest Certification
- **SBP**: Sustainable Biomass Program
- **RSB**: Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials
- **ISCC**: International Sustainability and Carbon Certification

### Method Selection Guidelines

When selecting an identification method, consider:

1. **Context Requirements**
    - Location constraints and environment
    - Volume and frequency of tracking
    - Integration with existing systems

2. **Regulatory Compliance**
    - Required by applicable frameworks
    - Accepted confidence levels
    - Documentation and audit requirements

3. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**
    - Implementation and operational costs
    - Expected accuracy and reliability
    - Scalability and future expansion

4. **Technology Readiness**
    - Current deployment maturity
    - Risk tolerance for new technology
    - Support and maintenance availability

### Example Use Cases

1. **High-Volume Mill Operations**
    - Primary: RFID for automated gate scanning
    - Secondary: Photo documentation for verification
    - Confidence: 90-95% combined

2. **Small-Scale Forest Operations**
    - Primary: QR codes for cost-effectiveness
    - Secondary: Manual ID as backup
    - Confidence: 70-80% combined

3. **Research and Development Projects**
    - Primary: Biometric optical scanning
    - Secondary: RFID for comparison validation
    - Confidence: 85-97% (improving with technology)
