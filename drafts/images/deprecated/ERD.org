- Attributes:
  - Category (Pre-consumer, Post-consumer)
  - Quantity

**Notes:**
- Relationships represent the connections described in the key relationships section.
- Attributes marked with `OPT` are optional according to the context provided in the description.
- `date` and `float` for data types have been assumed as per regular entity attributes presentation format.

Mermaid.js syntax provides a straightforward way to visualize these relationships, making it easier to understand the structure and flow of the FSC CoC system from entities and their dependencies.

** Integrated ERD

*** Textual Description
Okay, I understand you're requesting a textual description of an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) structure that integrates concepts and requirements from the provided SBP, RSB, FSC, and ISO sources, as well as the "Guidance Chain of Custody" document. This description aims to be similar in style and format to the "SBP Data Standard ERD Description" you provided, outlining key entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.

As a text-based AI, I cannot generate a visual ERD image. However, I can provide a comprehensive textual description of the entities, their attributes as defined across the sources, and the key relationships that connect them, based on the information in your sources and our conversation history.

This structure represents the core components and their interactions necessary to document and transfer information about solid biomass for energy applications within a Chain of Custody system, drawing on the requirements of various standards and guidance documents.

Here is a textual representation of the key entities and their relationships, integrating concepts from the provided sources:

**** Key Entities and Their Attributes:

Based on the data elements identified in your sources [1, 6, 7, 85, etc.], the core entities for an integrated biomass data standard would include:

- *Organization:* Represents a legal entity within the biomass supply chain that takes legal ownership of feedstock or biomass. This entity is also referred to as a "link" in the Chain of Custody.
  - /Attributes:/ *Organization Name*, *Address*, *Role* within the supply chain (e.g., source, transport, link, energy producer, Biomass Producer (BP), Trader, Energy Producer, Manufacturer), *Scope of Operations/Certification* (e.g., Product Types, Processes, Applicable Standards (SBP, FSC, RSB, etc.), Accounting Methodology like Mass Balance or Physical Separation), *Legal Entity Status*, *Unique Certificate Code/Number* (if certified) (e.g., SBP-XX-YY), *Contact Information*.
- *Certification Scheme:* Represents a voluntary or recognized standard system related to biomass or wood Chain of Custody and sustainability. Governing or approving specific schemes is out of scope for the data standard.
  - /Attributes:/ *Scheme Name* (e.g., FSC, PEFC, SBP, RSB, ISO 38200, Guidance), *Recognition Status* (e.g., SBP-recognised, approved for specific criteria), *Version Number* (of the scheme standard).
- *Certificate:* The formal certification document issued by an accredited Certification Body to an Organization.
  - /Attributes:/ *Certificate ID* (unique identifier with pattern validation), *Certificate Number* (official number as issued by certification body), *Date of Issue*, *Date of Expiry*, *Scope of Certification* (detailed description of what is covered), *Version Number* (integer version of the standard certified against, minimum 1), *Certification Body ID* (reference to issuing CB), *Organization ID* (reference to certificate holder), *Certification Scheme ID* (reference to applicable scheme), *Status* (active, expired, suspended, revoked, pending), *Product Types* (array of product types covered), *Processes* (array of processes covered), *Sites* (array of site objects with site ID, name, and address), *Accounting Methodology* (Mass Balance, Physical Separation, Credit System, Book and Claim), *Applicable Standards* (array of standards referenced), *Attachments* (array of certificate documents with filename, URL, and file type), *Last Updated* (timestamp of record update).
