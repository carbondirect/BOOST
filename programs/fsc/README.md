# FSC - Forest Stewardship Council

BOOST implementation for Forest Stewardship Council chain of custody certification.

## Overview

The **Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)** is an international organization that promotes responsible management of the world's forests through certification. This BOOST extension provides entity framework and workflow support for FSC chain of custody tracking.

### Key Features

ðŸš§ **FSC Material Tracking** - Certified forest product chain of custody  
ðŸš§ **Mixed Claims** - Percentage-based FSC content tracking  
ðŸš§ **Certificate Management** - FSC certificate validation and tracking  
ðŸš§ **Volume Reconciliation** - Input/output volume accounting  
ðŸš§ **Label Claims** - FSC label eligibility verification  

## Quick Start

### FSC Program Background

**Administrator**: Forest Stewardship Council International  
**Program Type**: Forest certification and chain of custody tracking  
**Certification**: Third-party certification bodies  
**Standards**: FSC-STD-40-004 (Chain of Custody)  

### Key Components

- **FSC Certificates**: Forest management and chain of custody certificates
- **Controlled Wood**: Non-FSC material meeting controlled requirements
- **Mixed Claims**: Percentage FSC content in products
- **Volume Credit**: Transfer of FSC attributes between batches

## Documentation

### Available Documentation
- **Examples**: Sample FSC certification objects
  - `fsc_certificate.json` - Certificate structure example
  - `fsc_certification_body.json` - Certification body data
  - `fsc_certification_scheme.json` - Scheme definition

### Documentation Needed
- [ ] FSC Implementation Guide
- [ ] FSC Workflow Specification  
- [ ] FSC Entity Mapping
- [ ] FSC Validation Checklist

## FSC Entities (Planned)

### Enhanced Core Entities
- `Organization` + FSC certificate numbers and scope
- `Transaction` + FSC claim types and percentages
- `Material` + FSC status and controlled wood verification
- `Certificate` + FSC-specific certificate attributes

### New FSC Entities
- `FSCClaim` - FSC content claims and percentages
- `VolumeCredit` - FSC volume credit accounting
- `FSCReporting` - Annual FSC reporting data

## FSC Chain of Custody Process

### 1. Material Input
- FSC-certified materials with valid certificates
- Controlled wood materials meeting FSC requirements
- Non-FSC materials for mixed products

### 2. Volume Accounting
- Input volume tracking by FSC status
- Production volume calculations
- Output volume allocation

### 3. Claim Calculation
- FSC percentage calculations for mixed products
- Volume credit transfers between batches
- Label eligibility determinations

### 4. Certificate Maintenance
- Annual FSC certificate renewal
- Surveillance audit compliance
- Sales data reporting to certification body

## Implementation Status

**Current Status**: ðŸ“‹ **Planning Phase**
- Sample certification data available
- Entity design concepts identified
- FSC standard review in progress

**Next Steps**:
1. Develop FSC entity specifications based on FSC-STD-40-004
2. Create chain of custody workflow documentation
3. Build volume accounting and claim calculation systems
4. FSC database integration planning
