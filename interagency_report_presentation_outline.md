# **Interagency Chain of Custody Report - Presentation Outline**

## **Slide 1: Title Slide**
**Biomass Tracking System Development**  
**Final Report Presentation**

*Contract #4023-015 / 23ISD015*  
*Carbon Direct for California Department of Conservation*  
*In partnership with CARB, CAL FIRE, CPUC*

## **Slide 2: Original Scope of Work**
**Contract #4023-015: $245,000 • Aug 2024 - Aug 2025**

**Contracted Deliverables (5 Tasks):**
- **Task 1**: Monthly interagency coordination and quarterly reporting
- **Task 2**: Meta-analysis of existing biomass tracking and CoC models/solutions  
- **Task 3**: Summary of relevant program requirements (LCFS, BioMAT, CEQA)
- **Task 4**: Integration recommendations for state activities and certification models
- **Task 5**: Final report (ADA-compatible) plus presentation summary

**Project Objective**: Develop CoC system recommendations for tracking forest biomass from source to product, enhancing data visibility while reducing compliance costs and supporting LCFS eligibility

## **Slide 3: Research Methodology**
**Comprehensive Multi-Stakeholder Approach**

- **Literature Review**: Existing biomass tracking systems and regulatory frameworks
- **Stakeholder Interviews**: 40+ participants across 5 stakeholder groups
  - Biomass Certification & Operations Experts
  - Supply-Chain Experts  
  - Reporting Stakeholders
  - NGO & Tribal Community Stakeholders
  - California State Agencies
- **Interagency Working Group**: Collaborative development with state partners
- **Industry Working Group**: Facilitated adoption pathway

## **Slide 4: Current System Challenges**
**Pain Points Across the Supply Chain**

- **Fragmented Tracking**: Multiple disconnected systems and spreadsheets
- **Manual Data Entry**: Labor-intensive, error-prone processes
- **Compliance Burden**: Separate reporting for LCFS, RFS, BioRAM contracts
- **Traceability Gaps**: Difficulty linking processed materials to original sources
- **Privacy Concerns**: Sensitive permit/pricing data in siloed systems

*"Current practices...still get re-entered manually...an extra 'unnecessary' duplication"* - Industry Stakeholder

## **Slide 5: Key Findings - System Requirements**
**Cross-Stakeholder Consensus on Core Needs**

**High Priority Requirements:**
- Unified data standard replacing fragmented processes
- Mobile-first, offline-capable field applications
- Automated integration with existing systems (LIMS, ERP)
- Mass-balance accounting vs. physical segregation
- Geographic data with privacy protection

**Critical Design Principles:**
- Reduce administrative overhead
- Leverage existing data sources (THPs, permits)
- Support percentage-based compliance tracking
- Accommodate diverse feedstock types

## **Slide 6: BOOST Data Standard Overview** 
**Technical Solution Architecture**
- **Standards-Based Approach**: Open-source, W3C Community Group development
- **Modular Design**: Core entities + regulatory program extensions  
- **Key Data Models**: TraceableUnit, Geographic tracking, Certification integration
- **Compliance Support**: LCFS, RFS, BioRAM, FSC/SFI integration
- **Implementation Ready**: Version 1.0 ready for pilot testing

**Technology Stack**: JSON-LD schemas, mobile applications, API integration

## **Slide 7: System Benefits & Impact**
**Quantified Value Proposition**

**Operational Efficiency:**
- 50%+ reduction in duplicate data entry
- Automated compliance reporting generation
- Real-time audit trail capability
- Streamlined multi-program reporting

**Regulatory Benefits:**

- Agency reporting system integration

**Phase 3: Market Scaling**
- Commercial supply chain deployment
- Certification program integration
- Stakeholder training and adoption

**Timeline**: 18-24 months for full implementation

## **Slide 9: Stakeholder Adoption Strategy**
**Building Industry Consensus**

**Industry Working Group Engagement:**
- 25+ organizations across supply chain
- Hands-on BOOST testing and feedback
- Workflow integration planning
- Training and support framework

**State Agency Coordination:**
- Multi-agency implementation team
- Regulatory integration planning  
- Policy alignment and harmonization
- Performance monitoring framework

**Key Success Factors:**
- Demonstrate marginal cost improvements
- Staged rollout with pilot programs
- Field crew input during beta testing

## **Slide 10: Next Steps & Recommendations**
**Path Forward for System Deployment**

**Contract Deliverables Completed:**
- ✅ Meta-analysis of existing tracking systems and CoC models
- ✅ Comprehensive stakeholder engagement (40+ interviews, 5 stakeholder groups)
- ✅ Program requirements analysis (LCFS, BioMAT, CEQA integration)
- ✅ BOOST data standard development and technical recommendations
- ✅ Final report with integration recommendations for state activities

**Next Phase Implementation:**
- **Immediate (0-6 months)**: Pilot programs with volunteer participants, finalize BOOST v1.0
- **Medium-term (6-18 months)**: Commercial pilots, agency system integration, training programs  
- **Long-term (18+ months)**: Full commercial deployment, expansion to agricultural biomass

**Funding Requirements**: Next-phase development, pilot support, and implementation assistance
