** FSC

*** Text ERD

Okay, I can provide a textual description of the entities and relationships for an FSC Chain of Custody (CoC) data standard, drawing upon the information in the provided sources and our conversation history, similar to the SBP ERD description.

This description outlines the core components and their connections as defined or implied by the FSC Chain of Custody standards and related documents you provided. It would form the basis for a technical specification for data exchange in the FSC CoC system.

Here is a textual representation of the key entities and their relationships for an FSC CoC data standard:

**** Key Entities and Their Attributes

***** Organization
Represents a legal entity within the supply chain that takes legal ownership of forest-based materials and products.

  - Control System applied to this group

***** Control System
The specific method (Transfer, Percentage, or Credit) used by the Organization to control the quantity of materials within a Product Group that can be sold with a particular FSC Claim.
- Attributes:
  - System Type (Transfer, Percentage, Credit)
  - Parameters specific to the system (e.g., defined claim periods, conversion factors, rules for calculating percentages or credits, account balances)

***** FSC Claim
A statement on Sales/Delivery Documents or product labels that identifies the certified nature of a product. This claim must correspond to the material inputs and the Control System used.
- Attributes:
  - Claim Type (e.g., FSC 100%, FSC Mix x%, FSC Recycled x%, FSC Mix Credit, FSC Recycled Credit, FSC Controlled Wood)
  - Percentage or Credit Value (for Mix/Recycled claims where applicable)
  - Linked Sales/Delivery Document ID

***** Sales/Delivery Document

  - Severity (Minor or Major)
  - Linked Audit ID
  - Required Corrective Action and deadline for resolution

***** Reclaimed Material
Material that would have otherwise been disposed of as waste but is instead collected and reclaimed as input material. Specific requirements apply to sourcing reclaimed material (FSC-STD-40-007). It is classified as either pre-consumer or post-consumer.
- Attributes:
  - Category (Pre-consumer, Post-consumer)
  - Quantity
  - Source/Point of Reclamation

***** Controlled Wood

- Attributes:
  - Quantity
  - Sourcing Area
  - Documentation proving assessment against FSC-STD-40-005

***** Contractor

***** Stakeholder
Any person, group, or entity that can affect or be affected by FSC decisions or activities. While not a core data entity for transactions, engagement with stakeholders is a requirement for organizations.
- Attributes (not specifically detailed as structured data):
  - General contact/interest information

***** Due Diligence System (DDS)
While not an entity in itself, it is a required process described in ISO 38200:2018 and referenced in the SBP context. Organizations must establish and implement a DDS to verify information about the characteristics of all Input Material. This process determines whether input material is eligible based on defined requirements.
- Note: In the FSC context, sourcing controlled wood or reclaimed material involves processes analogous to a DDS.

**** Key Relationships Between Entities

- A Transaction occurs between a Seller Organization and a Buyer Organization (documented on the Sales/Delivery Document).
- A CB conducts Audit(s) of an Organization to verify conformance.
- An Audit may identify Non-conformance(s).
- An Organization must address Non-conformance(s) (via corrective actions).
- Reclaimed Material is a type of Input Material, requiring specific sourcing requirements.
- Controlled Wood is a type of Input Material (specifically 'controlled material').
- An Organization may contract Contractor(s) to perform activities related to Input Material or Output Product handled under its CoC scope.
- Input Material characteristics are verified through implementing a Due Diligence System or equivalent processes.
- Information on Sales/Delivery Document(s), including the FSC Claim(s) and Seller's Certificate Code, must be linked to the specific products and be traceable upstream.

**Notes:**
- Relationships represent the connections described in the key relationships section.
- Attributes marked with `OPT` are optional according to the context provided in the description.
- `date` and `float` for data types have been assumed as per regular entity attributes presentation format.

Mermaid.js syntax provides a straightforward way to visualize these relationships, making it easier to understand the structure and flow of the FSC CoC system from entities and their dependencies.
