# Biomass Chain of Custody (CoC) Data Standard Community Group

## Overview
This repository contains the working draft and artifacts of the Biomass Chain of Custody (CoC) Data Standard, which defines a robust and interoperable data model for tracking biomass through complex supply chains. The standard supports transparent, verifiable, and consistent data exchange to enable sustainability, regulatory compliance, and supply chain integrity.

## Goals
The goals of the Biomass CoC Data Standard Community Group are to:
- Define an extensible and flexible data standard for use in biomass Chain of Custody systems. 
- Enable auditable tracking of biomass materials across the supply chain.
- Support certification and reporting schemes such as SBP, FSC, RSB, CalRecycle, LCFS, etc.
- Represent Chain of Custody (CoC) models including mass balance, physical separation, and crediting.
- Enable the creation of software to automate tracking and validation. 
- Promote interoperability across systems used by suppliers, regulators, certifiers, and end users.

---

## Scope
The standard will cover:
- **Organizations**: legal entities involved in handling or transferring biomass.
- **Biomass Consignments**: representations of batches or transactions of biomass.
- **Biomass Categories and Types**: classification schemes based on source and processing.
- **Sustainability Attributes**: including GHG data, certification, claims, and source details.
- **CoC Control Models**: mass balance, physical segregation, crediting.
- **Mass Balance Accounts**: tracking input and output flows.
- **Verification Statements and Certificates**: issued by third parties.
- **Transaction Documentation**: sales and delivery records.
- **Emission Reporting Fields**: data needed for SAR/SREG forms.

The standard will be designed for technical implementation using formats such as JSON Schema, XML, and RDF.

### Out of Scope
- Setting sustainability criteria (handled by regulatory and certification bodies).
- GHG emission methodologies (defined by various standards and entities).
- Audit and verification procedures.
- Certification scheme design and governance.
- Legal interpretation of contracts or organizational liability.

---

## Deliverables
- **Specification**: formal definition of high-level entities, fields, relationships, and control models.
- **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)**: visual representations of data relationships.
- **JSON Payload Examples**: showing valid structure for common data flows.
- **Validation Schemas**: for checking data conformity.
- **Test Suites**: optional support for validation and implementation testing.
- **Reference Implementations**: optional tools and libraries.

## Why This Standard Matters

### Data Standards in Chain of Custody Systems
Chain of custody systems depend on data standards to ensure:
- Consistency in how data is captured and interpreted
- Secure and traceable tracking of transactions and materials
- Transparent and auditable verification of sustainability claims
- Reduce duplication of effort throughout the supply chain. 

### Key Elements of a CoC Data Standard
- **Identification Fields**: unique and structured item identifiers
- **Handler Information**: metadata about entities processing or transferring materials
- **Temporal and Location Data**: timestamps and location metadata for traceability
- **Authentication Metadata**: certificates, signatures, or third-party verification

### Role in Interoperability
Standardized data formats make it possible to:
- Share records across jurisdictions and organizations
- Integrate with legacy systems, regulatory platforms, and certification databases
- Maintain traceability across multi-step, multi-actor supply chains
- Automate validation between and within different chain of custody standards.

### Validation and Compliance
Validation rules help ensure:
- Required fields are present and correctly formatted
- Field types and constraints are respected
- Data supports legal and certification requirements
